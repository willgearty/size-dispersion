While the range of <em>L. castroviejoi</em> partially overlaps that of <em>L. granatensis</em> and <em>L. europaeus</em> on the Iberian Peninsula, no hybridization has been detected with these forms. Recent studies have shown that instead, based on ecological, molecular and morphological characteristics, it is most closely related to <em>L. corsicanus</em>; some believe these two are conspecific (Alves <em>et al.</em> 2008, Acevedo <em>et al.</em> 2014, Ballesteros 2018). Additionally, two different occurrences of introgression of mtDNA from <em>L. timidus </em>into <em>L. castroviejoi</em> have been documented – indicating that these two forms have come into contact and hybridized two different times in the past, most recently during the last deglaciation (Melo-Ferreira <em>et al</em>. 2005, 2012; Ballesteros 2018).

However, Palacios (1996) studied historical museum  specimen and described new morphological traits that provided phenotypic  support for the species rank of the Corsican Hare. Recent molecular  studies confirmed that <em>L. corsicanus</em> is a phylogenetically distinct  species, which can be identified by concordant morphological and mtDNA  traits. It is reproductively isolated and apparently does not hybridize  with sympatric <em>L. europaeus</em> in continental Italy (Mengoni <em>et al.</em>  2014), however, in Corsica, Pietri, Alves and Melo-Ferreira (2011)  discovered a few hybrids resulting from crossbreeding of <em>L. corsicanus  </em>with <em>L. europaeus</em> and <em>L. granatensis</em>. Phylogenetical analyses suggested  that corsicanus and europaeus are not closely related sister taxa, but  belong to distinct evolutionary lineages that dispersed in western  Europe in different periods during the early Pleistocene. <em>L. corsicanus</em>  probably differentiated in isolated refuges in southern Italy during the  last glaciation.

<br>The subspecies of <i>Hylobates lar</i>, although numerous and well-distributed latitudinally, are not highly distinct, in general. They are based largely on relatively minor body color variation and the degree of polychromatism of the fur (Brockelman 1985, 2004; Groves 2001; Woodruff 2005) The validity of <i>H. l. yunnanensis</i> as a subspecies is doubtful; it requires comparison with <i>H. l. carpenteri</i> (C.

The early studies of Kellogg and Goldman (1944) relied in the classification of spider monkeys based on the geographical distribution and several morphological characters. <em>A. fusciceps robustus </em>Allen, 1914 is considered a junior synonym of <em>A. f. rufiventris</em> Sclater, 1871 following Heltne and Kunkel (1975) (see Rylands <em>et al. </em>2000). Silva-López <em>et al</em>. (1996) argued that<em> Ateles geoffroyi pan</em> was not a valid taxon. Since the earliest studies on the taxonomy of spider monkeys, <em>A. fusciceps </em>has been considered either within the <em>geoffroyi</em> clade or as a sister taxa to <em>A. geoffroyi</em> based on morphological characters (Froehlich<em> et al. </em>1991) or molecular data (Collins and Dubach 2000). <br/><br/>Collins and Dubach (2000) argued that the forms<em> fusciceps</em> and <em>rufiventris </em>are subspecies of <em>Ateles geoffroyi</em>.

Recent molecular data has suggested that the Mesoamerican spider monkeys (<em>Ateles geoffroyi</em>) and spider monkeys in north-western South America (<em>Ateles fusciceps</em>) shared a common ancestor nearly 2.2 Mya, and that both disjunct subspecies <em>A.f. fusciceps </em>and<em> A.f.rufiventris</em> shared a common ancestor nearly 1.3 Mya (Morales-Jimenez <em>et al. </em>2015b).

The relationships of the monkeys within the vervet/grivet group and to other guenons are conflicting. Even though Grubb et al.

This designation has been followed by most others. Within the group <em>Chlorocebus</em>, there is disagreement as to whether the different geographic morphs are subspecies or species. Both Groves (2001) and Skinner and Chimimba (2005) regard them as separate species. Grubb (2006) regards <em>Chlorocebus</em> as a geospecies. Using 19.7 million single nucleotide variations (SNV), Warren et al. (2015) found that the differences between animals in different locations are more similar to subspecies differences in other widespread semi-terrestrial primates. Recent work on mtDNA variation finds that although there are differences between local populations, these differences do not rise to the level of subspecific distinctions within the assessment region (Turner et al. 2016)."

However, there is a wide area of overlap in the distribution of forms attributable to <em>O. monteiri </em>and <em>O. crassicaudatus</em> in Tanzania (Groves 2001). For the current assessment, <em>O. monteiri </em>is regarded as a subspecies of <em>O. crassicaudatus</em> based on information regarding its skull morphology (Masters and Lubinsky 1988) and karyotype (Masters 1986). Greater galago subspecies show minor differences in skull size but not in proportions, while skulls of the two recognized <em>Otolemur</em>&#160;species can readily be distinguished on the basis of skull proportions. <em>O. crassicaudatus</em> subspecies are defined mainly on pelage coloration, which is likely to be adapted to the foliage in which the animals rest during the day, rather than for specific-mate recognition. Hence, the subspecies that occupy dry forests in miombo woodlands (<em>O. c. monteiri, O. c. argentatus</em>) are pale in color, while those from the dune forests of KwaZulu-Natal and the montane forests of Limpopo Province (<em>O. c. crassicaudatus</em>) are darker."

Wilson and Reeder (2005) and Fedosenko and Blank (2005) recognize nine subspecies: <em>O. a. ammon</em>, <em>O. a. collium</em>, <em>O. a. comosa</em> (= <em>jubata</em>), <em>O. a. darwini</em>, <em>O. a. hodgsoni</em>, <em>O. a. karelini</em>, <em>O. a. nigrimontana</em>, <em>O. a. polii</em>, and <em>O. a. severtzovi</em>. Geist (1991) recognized all of these except <em>collium</em> and <em>severtzovi</em> (which at the time was still considered a urial); he also considered that <em>jubata</em> had precedence over <em>comosa</em>. Shackleton and Lovari (1997) followed Geist’s (1991) classification except for adding <em>collium</em> as a valid subspecies. Within China, some authors have recognized additional subspecies. Wang (2002) recognized <em>O. a. littledalei, adametzi</em>, and <em>sairensis</em> (all within the range occupied by <em>karelini</em> or <em>collium</em> by the above authorities), and <em>dalailamae</em> (within the range occupied by <em>hodgsoni</em>, above) in addition to <em>ammon</em> and <em>darwini</em> (but did not recognize <em>O. a. jubata</em>). Yu (2001) recognized <em>dalailamae</em> as distinct from <em>hodgsoni</em>, but did not recognize the subdivisions within <em>karelini</em> or <em>collium</em> (and also did not recognize <em>jubata</em>). Mitchell and Frisina (2007) recognized <em>ammon, darwini, jubata, dalailamae</em>, and <em>hodgsoni</em> (as well as <em>karelini, nigrimontana</em>, and <em>severtzovi</em> under <em>O. polii</em>). Tserenbataa <em>et al</em>. (2004), based on mtDNA analysis, questioned the validity of separating <em>O. a. ammon</em> and <em>darwini</em> within Mongolian populations. There is uncertainty regarding the subspecific status of Argali in Gansu and adjacent Inner Mongolia; there are also differing opinions regarding the morphometric and/or geographic separation between <em>polii</em> and <em>karelini</em>. It may well be that future genetic work, similarly to Tserenbataa <em>et al</em>. (2004) and Wu <em>et al</em>. (2003) will suggest that clinal, rather than threshold variation characterizes many argali populations.  Clearly, more research is required to clarify the taxonomy of the species. <br/>  <br/>Because subspecific taxonomy remains unresolved, most subspecies that are recognized cross international borders, and the species occurs in many countries with differing management regimes, this account treats <em>Ovis ammon</em> by country (and, where appropriate, by population) rather than by subspecies. <br/>  <br/>Subspecies found in Mongolia: Recent genetic studies (Tserenbataa 2003, Tserenbataa <em>et al</em>. 2004) suggest that all Argali in Mongolia represent a single subspecies. Two subspecies were formerly recognized, Altai Argali <em>O. a. ammon</em> and Gobi Argali or Mongolian Argali <em>O. a. darwini</em>."

1808,Aotus lemurinus,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,PRIMATES,MAMMALIA,AOTIDAE,Aotus,lemurinus,,,,,"I. Geoffroy, 1846","The taxonomy of night monkeys (<em>Aotus </em>spp.) has been debated and still does not provide a complete picture of the diversity of the genus Aotus. Ruiz-Herrera <em>et al.</em> (2005) reported that cytogenetic studies have characterised 18 different karyotypes with diploid numbers ranging from 46 to 58 chromosomes. The taxonomy of the night monkeys essentially followed the early revision by Hershkovitz (1983), with some modifications for the Colombian and Central American forms. Recent molecular studies have made valuable contributions towards the understanding of night monkeys taxonomy and phylogenetic relations (Plautz <em>et al.</em>2009; Menezes <em>et al.</em> 2010). <br/><br/>Reviewing the entire taxonomy and distributions of the night monkeys, <em>Aotus</em>, Ford (1994) carried out multivariate analyses of craniodental measures and pelage patterns and color, and also took into consideration chromosomal data and blood protein variations. Ford (1994) concluded that there was “good support” for just two species north of the Río Amazonas: <em>A. trivirgatus</em> (Humboldt, 1812) east and north of the Rio Negro, and the polymorphic <em>A. vociferans</em> to the west of the Rio Negro. <em>Aotus vociferans</em>, as such, would include all the forms north of the Río Amazonas/Solimões in Brazil (west of the Rio Negro), Peru, Colombia and Ecuador, and in the Chocó, northern Colombia and Colombian Andes, and Panama: <em>brumbacki</em>, <em>lemurinus</em>, <em>griseimembra</em>, and <em>zonalis</em>. <br/> <br/>Hernández-Camacho and Cooper (1976) restricted both <em>lemurinus</em> (Colombian Andes, elevations from 1,000 to 1,500&#160;m up to 3,000–3,200&#160;m) and <em>griseimembra</em> (northern lowlands, Santa Marta mountains, west to Río Sinú, Río San Jorge, lower Río Cauca and lowlands of middle and upper Río Magdalena) to Colombia, while recognizing the form <em>zonalis </em>as the night monkey of north-western Colombia (Chocó) and Panama. Hershkovitz (1983) recognized <em>lemurinus</em> and <em>griseimembra</em> as distinct, but considered them to be subspecies of a single species; he made no mention of the name zonalis, but as he ascribed Central American night monkeys to <em>A. lemurinus lemurinus</em>, by implication he was regarding it as a synonym of this latter form. Groves (2001) followed Hernández-Camacho and Cooper (1976) in recognizing <em>zonalis</em> as the form in Panama, and listed it as a subspecies of <em>lemurinus</em> along with <em>griseimembra</em> and <em>brumbacki</em> Hershkovitz, 1983. Defler <em>et al</em>. (2001) concluded that the karyotype of <em>Aotus hershkovitzi</em> Ramirez-Cerquera, 1983 (from the upper Río Cusiana, Boyacá, Colombia; 2n = 58) was in fact that of true <em>lemurinus</em>, and that the karyotypes which Hershkovitz (1983) had considered to be those of <em>lemurinus </em>were in fact of <em>zonalis</em>. Defler <em>et al.</em> (2001) and others (Defler 2003, 2004; Defler and Bueno 2003) concluded that <em>Aotus lemurinus </em>of Hershkovitz (1983) is in fact three karyotypically well-defined species, and that the night monkeys of the lowlands of Panama and the Chocó region of Colombia belong to the species <em>A. zonalis</em>, and those of the Magdalena valley to <em>A. griseimembra</em>, while those above altitudes of 1,500 m should correctly be referred to as <em>A. lemurinus</em>. For a review of the taxonomy of the night monkeys of Panama and northern Colombia see Rylands <em>et al.</em> (2006). <br/> <br/>Defler and Bueno (2007) discussed the karyology of the grey-necked night monkeys and reaffirmed the validity of <em>A. brumbacki</em>, <em>A. griseimembra</em>, <em>A. lemurinus</em>, <em>A. trivirgatus</em>, <em>A. vociferans</em> and <em>A. zonalis</em>."

For example, Silva-López&#160;<em>et al</em>. (1996) exemplified the enormous variation in pelage coloration of&#160;<em>Ateles</em>&#160;in Mexico, Guatemala and Belize and concluded that&#160;<em>A. g. pan</em>&#160;Schlegel, 1876 and&#160;<em>A. g. yucatanensis</em>&#160;Kellogg and Goldman, 1944 was within the variation of&#160;<em>A. g. vellerosus</em>.

Based on phylogenetic analyses of small fragments of mitochondrial DNA genes, Collins and Dubach (2000) recognized a northern and a southern group of spider monkeys in Central America, but due to their fragmentary sampling could not properly evaluate subspecies distinctiveness. Using ~800 bp of the mtDNA control region, Morales-Jiménez<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;(2015) analyzed the phylogenetic relationships of 49 spider monkeys sampled across Central America, and concluded that individuals from Mexico, Guatemala and Belize should be considered as part of&#160;<em>A. g. vellerosus</em>, while individuals from El Salvador should not be included in this taxon. They also found that individuals from southwestern Nicaragua and northwestern Costa Rica should be considered as&#160;<em>A. g. frontatus</em>&#160;and individuals from Azuero peninsula formed a monophyletic clade, supporting their recognition as distinct subspecies. However, despite recent efforts to improve our understanding of the phylogenetic relationships of the different subspecies of&#160;<em>A. geoffroyi</em>, conclusive results regarding the taxonomic validity of its subspecies still require analyses that include samples of individuals from southern Guatemala, Honduras, northern and eastern Nicaragua, central and western Panama, and eastern Costa Rica.Here, we tentatively recognized six subspecies:&#160;<em>Ateles geoffroyi geoffroyi</em>,&#160;<em>Ateles geoffroyi azuerensis</em>,&#160;<em>Ateles geoffroyi frontatus</em>,&#160;<em>Ateles geoffroyi grisescens</em>,&#160;<em>Ateles geoffroyi ornatus</em>,&#160;<em>Ateles geoffroyi vellerosus</em>.."

Although Arnoux’s Beaked Whale (<em>B</em>. <em>arnuxii</em>) of the southern oceans and Baird’s Beaked Whale (<em>B</em>. <em>bairdii)</em> of the northern Pacific are almost morphologically indistinguishable, and have been suggested to be members of the same species (see Kasuya 2002), recent mitochondrial data confirmed that they are in fact separate species (Dalebout 2002). Using mitochondrial DNA to assess the taxonomy of beaked whales, Dalebout et al. (1998) found that the Southern Bottlenose Whale (<em>H</em>. <em>planiforns</em>), exhibits substantial intraspecific variation, even greater than the variation between the two Berardius species. This result could be attributed to either an effectively large population size, or multiple evolutionary significant units (Moritz 1994). Longman’s Beaked Whale, <em>I</em>. <em>pacificus</em>, in the Indo-Pacific was frequently misidentified as the Southern Bottlenose Whale, <em>H</em>. <em>planifrons</em>, due to the similarity in their external morphology (Pitman et al. 1999; Dalebout et al. 2003). A new genus,<em> Indopacetus</em>, was established for Longman’s Beaked Whale (initially classified as <em>Mesoplodon pacificus</em>), based predominantly on its cranial morphology (Moore 1968; Rice 1998). Although phylogenetic analyses failed to confirm the legitimacy of this genus, osteological features, including rib count, number of fused cervical vertebrae and cranial characteristics, may be sufficient to afford the Longman’s Beaked Whale its own separate genus (Dalebout et al. 2003). The majority of species within the family Ziphiidae fall under the genus <em>Mesoplodon</em>, five of which are located in South African waters (Best 2007). Aside from male tooth form, the morphological variation between <em>Mesoplodon</em> species is somewhat limited (Mead 1989). Recent mitochondrial DNA evidence revealed that specimens of <em>M</em>. <em>hectori</em> from the North Pacific and the southern hemisphere do not, in fact, represent the same species, and as a result the North Pacific population has been reclassified as <em>M</em>. <em>perrini </em>(Dalebout et al. 2002). Similarly, the disparate distribution of <em>M</em>. <em>mirus</em> between the northern and southern hemispheres may also prove to be separate species or subspecies, although this theory is yet to be confirmed. Cuvier’s Beaked Whales represent the single, global species of the monotypic genus <em>Ziphius </em>(Rice 1998; Dalebout et al. 2005). Substantial variation in morphology has been recorded across the range of the Cuvier’s Beaked Whale (Heyning 1989), inferring the existence of locally distinct populations."

Ferrari <em>et al</em>.

The similarities between <em>C. flaviceps</em> and <em>C. aurita</em> in pelage patterns such as the ear tufts and the skull-like facial mask, ecological adaptations, ontogeny (the infants are extremely similar), vocalizations and clinal variation in overall pelage colour, based this opinion (Coimbra-Filho 1986a,b; Coimbra-Filho <em>et al</em>. 1993).

Hershkovitz (1975, p.142) was the first to indicate that Wied-Neuwied (1826) had referred to the marmoset of south-east Bahia as “<em>Hapale penicillata Kuhlii</em>” [sic]. However, Hershkovitz (1975, 1977) argued at length that <em>kuhlii</em> was not a valid taxon, being merely an intergrade between <em>C. j. penicillata</em> and <em>C. j. geoffroy</em>i. Vivo (1991, pp.80-81), on the other hand, argued that Wied-Neuwied (1826) had not intentionally given it this name, merely, and incorrectly, ascribing the authorship of the name <em>penicillata</em>to Kuhl. The first person to intentionally use the name <em>kuhlii</em> to describe the marmosets from south-east Bahia was Hershkovitz (1975), but his argument that it was not a valid taxonomic entity disqualifies the possibility of him being attributed authorship.

Hershkovitz (1983) recognized <em>lemurinus</em> and <em>griseimembra</em> as distinct, but considered them to be subspecies of a single species; he made no mention of the name <em>zonalis</em>, but as he ascribed Central American night monkeys to <em>A. lemurinus lemurinus</em>, by implication he was regarding it as a synonym of this latter form.

Defler <em>et al.</em> (2001) and others (Defler 2003, 2004; Defler and Bueno 2003) concluded that <em>Aotus lemurinus</em> of Hershkovitz (1983) is in fact three karyotypically well-defined species, and that the night monkeys of the lowlands of Panama and the Chocó region of Colombia belong to the species <em>A. zonalis</em>, and those of the Magdalena valley to <em>A. griseimembra</em>, while those above altitudes of 1,500 m should correctly be referred to as <em>A. lemurinus</em>.

However, at least three studies including genetic information have shown no support for the splitting of <em>Lagothrix </em>species. For example, Botero and Stevenson (2014) found that the forms <em>lugens </em>and <em>lagothricha </em>in Colombia, which were originally defined by coat color, do not correspond with the mitochondrial phylogeny of the woolly monkeys (Botero<em> et al.</em> 2010). In addition, the lack of reciprocal monophyly between the putative subspecies of <em>Lagothrix lagothricha </em>was also evident when including Ecuadorian woolly monkeys (Botero<em> et al.</em> 2015). Similarly, Ruiz-García<em> et al.</em> (2014) found more support for Fooden’s (1963) classification using two mitochondrial genes. Finally, Defler (2014) describes huge variation in the patterns of coat color even within woolly monkey populations. Therefore, Defler does not agree with Groves (2001, 2005) in placing <em>L. lugens</em> as a distinct species and maintained it as a subspecies of<em> L. lagothricha</em>."

Ruiz-Herrera <i>et al.</i> (2005) reported that cytogenetic studies have characterized 18 different karyotypes with diploid numbers ranging from 46 to 58 chromosomes. The taxonomy of the night monkeys essentially follows the revision by Hershkovitz (1983), with some modifications for the Colombian and Central American forms. 
<br>
<br>Reviewing the entire taxonomy and distributions of the night monkeys, <i>Aotus</i>, Ford (1994) carried out multivariate analyses of craniodental measures and pelage patterns and colour, and also took into consideration chromosomal data and blood protein variations. Ford (1994) concluded that there was “good support” for just two species north of the Río Amazonas: <i>A. trivirgatus</i> (Humboldt, 1812) east and north of the Rio Negro, and the polymorphic <i>A. vociferans</i> to the west of the Rio Negro. <i>Aotus vociferans</i>, as such, would include all the forms north of the Río Amazonas/Solimões in Brazil (west of the Rio Negro), Peru, Colombia and Ecuador, and in the Chocó, northern Colombia and Colombian Andes, and Panama: <i>brumbacki</i>, <i>lemurinus</i>, <i>griseimembra</i>, and <i>zonalis</i>.
<br>
<br>Hernández-Camacho and Cooper (1976) restricted both <i>lemurinus</i> (Colombian Andes, elevations from 1,000 to 1500 m up to 3,000–3,200 m) and <i>griseimembra</i> (northern lowlands, Santa Marta mountains, west to Río Sinú, Río San Jorge, lower Río Cauca and lowlands of middle and upper Río Magdalena) to Colombia, while recognizing the form <i>zonalis </i>as the night monkey of north-western Colombia (Chocó) and Panama. Hershkovitz (1983) recognized <i>lemurinus</i> and <i>griseimembra</i> as distinct, but considered them to be subspecies of a single species; he made no mention of the name zonalis, but as he ascribed Central American night monkeys to <i>A. lemurinus lemurinus</i>, by implication he was regarding it as a synonym of this latter form. Groves (2001) followed Hernández-Camacho and Cooper (1976) in recognizing <i>zonalis</i> as the form in Panama, and listed it as a subspecies of <i>lemurinus</i> along with <i>griseimembra</i> and <i>brumbacki</i> Hershkovitz, 1983. Defler <i>et al</i>. (2001) concluded that the karyotype of <i>Aotus hershkovitzi</i> Ramirez-Cerquera, 1983 (from the upper Río Cusiana, Boyacá, Colombia; 2n = 58) was in fact that of true <i>lemurinus</i>, and that the karyotypes which Hershkovitz (1983) had considered to be those of <i>lemurinus </i>were in fact of <i>zonalis</i>. Defler <i>et al.</i> (2001) and others (Defler 2003, 2004; Defler and Bueno 2003) concluded that <i>Aotus lemurinus </i>of Hershkovitz (1983) is in fact three karyotypically well-defined species, and that the night monkeys of the lowlands of Panama and the Chocó region of Colombia belong to the species <i>A. zonalis</i>, and those of the Magdalena valley to <i>A. griseimembra</i>, while those above altitudes of 1500m should correctly be referred to as <i>A. lemurinus</i>. For a review of the taxonomy of the night monkeys of Panama and northern Colombia see Rylands <i>et al.</i> (2006).

Genetic and pelage differences, notably a greenish brown (olive) dorsum as opposed to light golden brown as is typical of&#160;<em>C. chiropotes</em>, distinguish it from the bearded sakis of the Guianas to the east of the Rio Branco. There is however, a possible confusion concerning the correct names. Silva-Júnior and Figueiredo (2002) argued that the form west of the Rio Branco is, correctly&#160;<em>Chiropotes chiropotes&#160;</em>(Humboldt, 1811), according to its type locality, and the form to the east of the Rio Branco, extending through the states of Pará and Amapá, and into the Guianas (Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana) is&#160;<em>C. sagulatus&#160;</em>(Traill, 1821) from Demerara (see Silva-Júnior&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2013). Doubts still remain, however, concerning Hershkovitz’s interpretation of Humboldt’s type locality of&#160;<em>C. chiropotes</em>, which would accordingly alter the nomenclature (J. P. Boubli, pers. comm). With the further research and phylogenetic analysis, both Traill’s&#160;<em>sagulatus&#160;</em>and Spix’s&#160;<em>israelita&#160;</em>may be valid species names for different populations of this wide ranging genus.

Longman’s Beaked Whale, <em>I</em>. <em>pacificus</em>, in the Indo-Pacific was frequently misidentified as the Southern Bottlenose Whale, <em>H</em>. <em>planifrons</em>, due to the similarity in their external morphology (Pitman et al. 1999; Dalebout et al. 2003). A new genus, <em>Indopacetus</em>, was established for Longman’s Beaked Whale (initially classified as <em>Mesoplodon pacificus</em>), based predominantly on its cranial morphology (Moore 1968; Rice 1998). Although phylogenetic analyses failed to confirm the legitimacy of this genus, osteological features, including rib count, number of fused cervical vertebrae and cranial characteristics, may be sufficient to afford the Longman’s Beaked Whale its own separate genus (Dalebout et al. 2003). The majority of species within the family Ziphiidae fall under the genus <em>Mesoplodon</em>, five of which are located in South African waters (Best 2007). Aside from male tooth form, the morphological variation between <em>Mesoplodon </em>species is somewhat limited (Mead 1989). Recent mitochondrial DNA evidence revealed that specimens of <em>M</em>. <em>hectori</em> from the North Pacific and the southern hemisphere do not, in fact, represent the same species, and as a result the North Pacific population has been reclassified as <em>M</em>. <em>perrini</em> (Dalebout et al. 2002). Similarly, the disparate distribution of <em>M</em>. <em>mirus</em> between the northern and southern hemispheres may also prove to be separate species or subspecies, although this theory is yet to be confirmed. Cuvier’s Beaked Whales represent the single, global species of the monotypic genus <em>Ziphius</em> (Rice 1998; Dalebout et al. 2005). Substantial variation in morphology has been recorded across the range of the Cuvier’s Beaked Whale (Heyning 1989), inferring the existence of locally distinct populations."

Rosenberger (1981), Rosenberger and Coimbra-Filho (1984), and Natori (1994) argued, on morphological terms, that the Pygmy Marmoset should correctly be included in the genus<em> Callithrix. </em>This was not maintained in Rosenberger<em> et al. </em>(1990), although Barroso (1995), Barroso<em> et al. </em>(1997), Moreira <em>et al. </em>(1996), Schneider <em>et al. </em>(1996), Schneider and Rosenberger (1996), Tagliaro <em>et al. </em>(1997), Porter<em> et al. </em>(1997a), and Canavez <em>et al. </em>(1999a) also argued for this arrangement on the basis of molecular genetics. The argument that<em> Cebuella </em>should be included in the genus <em>Callithrix </em>centers on the conclusion, from both morphological and genetic studies, that the Pygmy Marmoset is more closely related to the Amazonian marmosets (the argentata group of Hershkovitz [1977]) than the latter are to the Atlantic forest marmosets (the jacchus group of Hershkovitz [1977]). Schneider <em>et al.</em> (1993) and Schneider and Rosenberger (1996) also concluded that their molecular genetic data are compatible with jacchus and pygmaea being congeneric. Groves (2001, 2005) places the species in the genus <em>Callithrix, </em>subgenus <em>Cebuella. </em>Although closely related to the Amazonian marmosets, we believe that <em>Cebuella pygmaea </em>deserves generic status. The species shows very distinct features, unique among the callitrichids, involving not only its diminutive size, but also the tree-gouging specialization not observed to nearly the same extent in its Amazonian sister group. <br/><br/>If <em>Cebuella </em>is maintained as a separate genus, then the group would be paraphyletic unless the argentata group marmosets and the jacchus group marmosets are placed in different genera. This was the option adopted, with the Amazonian marmosets being placed in the genus Mico Lesson, 1840 (see below). This decision was also based on the clear identity of the three genera shown in all morphological and molecular studies available. <br/><br/>In 1940, Lönnberg described the subspecies <em>Cebuella pygmaea niveiventris </em>from Lago Ipixuna, south bank of the Rio Solimões, based on its sharply contrasting whitish chest, belly, and inner surface of arms and legs. The ventral surface of<em> C. p. pygmaea </em>is ochraceous. Cruz Lima (1945) and Napier (1976) also recognized and described the two subspecies. Hershkovitz (1977) argued that the colour of the underparts is individually and locally variable invalidating the subspecific status of niveiventris. However, van Roosmalen and van Roosmalen (1997) recently presented evidence for the validity of the two subspecies based on field observations and captive specimens of <em>C. p. niveiventris</em>, and confirmed its presence in the interfluvium of the Rios Purus and Madeira.<em><br/></em>"

Principal Components Analysis and Discriminant Analysis of skull measurements clustered <em>S. celebensis</em> with <em>S. philippensis</em> and <em>S. cebifrons</em> from the Philippines (Lucchini <em>et al</em>. 2005). From this study and that of Groves (1997) it was proposed that these species are primitive forms and have a relict distribution. <em>Sus celebensis</em> is thought to have separated from an ancestral species that inhabited Sunderland. Analysis of mtDNA found that <em>S. celebensis</em> had a greater maternal affinity to Bornean pigs than those from New Guinea (Larson <em>et al</em>. 2005), however, pigs from the Philippines were not included in the genetic study to allow comparison. Phylogenomic analysis implies that populations on Borneo acted as the initial and main source for the dispersal to Sulawesi. At a later stage <em>S. verrucosus</em> on Java and <em>S. cebifrons</em> in the Philippines are thought to have contributed to the <em>S. celebensis</em> gene pool (Frantz <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>The Sulawesi Warty Pig, like the other Asian <em>Sus</em> spp., has a chromosome number of 38 (Bosma <em>et al</em>. 1991).

This may lend support to the proposed cline in body size on Sulawesi from north (smallest) to south (largest) (Groves <em>et al</em>. 1993). The current classification of a monotypic species by Groves (1981) may warrant further genetic investigation. The two clades can be explained either by the occurrence of two colonization events onto Sulawesi (Frantz <em>et al</em>. 2013), or the historic fragmentation of the island into at least two parts. Independent invasions by other species have been reported, including macaques (Evans <em>et al</em>. 1999) and shrews (Ruedi <em>et al</em>. 1998).

Hershkovitz (1985) described a new species,&#160;<em>utahickae</em>, and classified&#160;<em>satanas&#160;</em>and&#160;<em>utahickae&#160;</em>as subspecies of<em>&#160;C. chiropotes.</em>&#160;Groves (2001, 2005) followed the taxonomy of Hershkovitz (1985). The three subspecies of&#160;<em>Chiropotes satanas&#160;</em>(<em>satanas</em>,&#160;<em>chiropotes&#160;</em>and&#160;<em>utahicki</em>) are here listed as full species following the recommendation of Silva-Júnior and Figueiredo (2002), Figueiredo&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2006), and Silva-Júnior&#160;<em>et al.</em>(2013). Bonvicino&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;(2003) resurrected the name&#160;<em>Chiropotes israelita&#160;</em>(Spix, 1823) for the bearded saki discovered by Boubli (2002) to the west of the Rio Branco, a tributary of the Rio Negro, Amazonas, Brazil. Genetic and pelage differences, notably a greenish brown (olive) dorsum as opposed to light golden brown as is typical of&#160;<em>C. chiropotes</em>, distinguish it from the bearded sakis of the Guianas to the east of the Rio Branco. There is however, a possible confusion concerning the correct names. Silva-Júnior and Figueiredo (2002) argued that the form west of the Rio Branco is, correctly&#160;<em>Chiropotes chiropotes&#160;</em>(Humboldt, 1811), according to its type locality, and the form to the east of the Rio Branco, extending through the states of Pará and Amapá, and into the Guianas (Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana) is&#160;<em>C. sagulatus&#160;</em>(Traill, 1821) from Demerara (see Silva-Júnior&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2013). Doubts still remain, however, concerning Hershkovitz’s interpretation of Humboldt’s type locality of&#160;<em>C. chiropotes</em>, which would accordingly alter the nomenclature (J. P. Boubli, pers. comm). With the further research and phylogenetic analysis, both Traill’s&#160;<em>sagulatus&#160;</em>and Spix’s&#160;<em>israelita&#160;</em>may be valid species names for different populations of this wide ranging genus.&#160;<br/><br/>The species name is currently in dispute. Hershkovitz (1985) named the subspecies <em>Chiropotes satanas utahicki</em>. However, as the species is named after a woman, in subsequent revisions authors renamed the species <em>Chiropotes</em> (<em>satanas</em>) <em>utahickae</em> (Silva Jr. and Figueiredo 2002; Groves 2005). Brandon-Jones <em>et al.</em> (2006) argue that the Latin gender suffix is part of its etymology and therefore unregulated by Article 31 of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, and that the author's selected suffix should be respected and the original spelling preserved."

Gonedelé Bi <em>et al</em>. (2014) subsequently conducted a survey in 2012 in the same region, but </span>Bolo-Dassiéko-Niégré complex had been converted into a cocoa plantation. They found one group in Grébouo I Forest Grove, which is in close proximity to Bolo, where they found that the monkeys had a similar pelage as <em>Colobus vellerosus</em>, but in one vocal aspect, they were similar to <em>Colobus polykomos</em>. However, modest vocal data analysed by these authors produced more complex results. In one parameter (duration), the roar was similar to <em>Colobus vellerosus</em>; whereas it was more similar to <em>Colobus polykomos </em>than to <em>Colobus vellerosus </em>in the number of roars or subunit calls. Hence, Gonedelé Bi <em>et al</em>. (2014) were reluctant to draw definitive conclusions based on vocalisations."

6337,Delphinus capensis,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,CETARTIODACTYLA,MAMMALIA,DELPHINIDAE,Delphinus,capensis,,,,,"Gray, 1828","South Africa is the type locality for <em>D</em>. <em>capensis</em>, yet there is an ongoing taxonomic debate about the existence of two species of common dolphins (Best 2007). The genetic differentiation between two sympatric species, the Short-Beaked Common Dolphin <em>D</em>.<em> delphis </em>and Long-Beaked Common Dolphin <em>D</em>. <em>capensis</em>, has to date only been demonstrated in the eastern North Pacific (Rosel <em>et al</em>. 1994) and subsequent analyses suggest that <em>D</em>. <em>capensis</em> is a polyphyletic taxon, with the long-beaked character being a convergent state found in a number of populations globally, probably induced by local ecological conditions (Natoli <em>et al.</em> 2006). Thus, in some regions, Long-Beaked Common Dolphins are genetically closer to Short-Beaked Common Dolphins than to Long-Beaked Common Dolphins elsewhere (Natoli <em>et al. </em>2006). A recent global analysis of the genus <em>Delphinus</em>, which included nine specimens from the west coast of South Africa (southwestern Atlantic), concluded that all specimens analysed from the Atlantic Ocean belong to <em>D</em>. <em>delphis</em> and that <em>D</em>. <em>capensis</em> is genetically an invalid species (Cunha<em> et al. </em>2015). However, no specimens from the east coast of South Africa were included in that analysis. In addition, an analysis of specimens from the east coast of South Africa indicated that these animals were the most differentiated of the long-beaked form, possibly reflecting an independent founder event (Natoli <em>et al. </em>2006).<br/><br/>Morphological data support the presence of <em>D</em>. <em>capensis</em> along the south and east coast of South Africa (Jefferson and van Waerebeek 2002, Samaai <em>et al. </em>2005). Based on cranial morphometrics of 153 common dolphin skulls from the Indo-Pacific region, including 43 from South Africa, all common dolphin specimens from South Africa belonged to the Long-beaked Common Dolphin (Jefferson and van Waerebeek 2002). Samaai <em>et al. </em>(2005) also found the vast majority of the specimens they examined to belong to <em>D</em>. <em>capensis</em>, baring two specimens stranded along the west coast with cranial characteristics that fell within the range of <em>D</em>. <em>delphis </em>from the North Pacific. The non-concordance of morphological and genetic data for this species results in much confusion and a more rigorous global revision is needed. For this reason the species name <em>D</em>. <em>capensis </em>has been retained here for animals found off the south-east coast of South Africa. The presence of a common dolphin in the Indian Ocean with an exceptionally long beak is recognised as a subspecies, <em>D</em>. <em>delphis</em>/<em>capensis tropicalis</em> (Van Bree and Gallagher 1978, Rice 1998, Jefferson and van Waerebeek 2002).<br/><br/><u>UAE Taxonomic Note</u><br/>There are now two accepted species, namely the Long-beaked Common Dolphin <em>D. capensis</em> and the Short-beaked Common Dolphin <em>D. delphis</em>. Those in the UAE resemble most closely the Long-beaked Common Dolphin (Baldwin <em>et al. </em>1999)."

Borneo's elephants have traditionally been included in <em>E. m. indicus</em> (Shoshani and Eisenberg 1982) or <em>E. m. sumatranus</em> (Medway 1977; but see Fernando <em>et al</em>. 2003 and Cranbrook <em>et al</em>. 2008 for discussion of whether the elephants of Borneo are indigenous to the island). These subspecies designations were based primarily on body size and minor differences in coloration, plus the fact that <em>E. m. sumatranus</em> has relatively larger ears and an extra pair of ribs (Shoshani and Eisenberg 1982). The Sri Lankan subspecies designation is weakly supported by analysis of allozyme loci (Nozawa and Shotake 1990), but not by analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences (Hartl <em>et al</em>. 1996, Fernando <em>et al</em>. 2000, Fleischer <em>et al</em>. 2001). However, current patterns of mtDNA variation suggest that the Sumatran subspecies is monophyletic (Fleischer <em>et al</em>. 2001), and consequently this taxon could be defined as an evolutionarily significant unit (ESU). This suggests that Sumatran elephants should be managed separately from other Asian elephants in captivity, and is also an argument for according particularly high priority to the conservation of Sumatran elephants in the wild. The status of evolutionarily significant unit has also been suggested for the Bornean elephants (Fernando <em>et al</em>. 2003). Two other proposed subspecies <em>E. m. asurus</em> and <em>E. m. rubridens</em> are extinct. A definitive subspecific classification awaits a detailed range-wide morphometric and genetic study."

Regarding <em>A. p. pigra</em> she mentioned “The differences, however, are so definite that they unquestionably indicate a separate subspecies; indeed, if it were not for the form found at Mountain Cow [<em>A. p. luctuosa</em>] which seems to be intermediate between this and typical <em>A. p. palliata</em>, one might be justified in calling it a distinct species” (Lawrance 1933, p. 334). Smith (1970) analyzed pelage coloration patterns, and cranial and dental features of 238 specimens from across the range of <em>A. palliata</em> (including those studied by Lawrence, 1933) and compared them with a population sample of two sympatric forms of howler monkeys from the state of Tabasco, Mexico. He determined that the two (partially sympatric) forms from his sample constituted two well-differentiated species, and thus recommended <em>A. pigra</em> to be considered full species and separated from <em>A. palliata</em>. He considered <em>A. p. luctuosa</em> Lawrence, 1933 as junior synonym of <em>A. pigra</em>. Most authors have considered <em>A. pigra</em> as the single species of Black howler in Central America (e.g., Groves 2001, 2005, Rylands <em>et al</em>. 2006). Napier (1976) discussed that <em>A. pigra </em>was in fact <em>A. villosa</em> (Gray 1845), and Brandon-Jones (2006) argued that <em>Alouatta pigra</em> Lawrence, 1933 is a junior synonym. However, due to the poor condition of the type specimen of <em>A. villosa</em>, the lack of compelling evidence (genetic or otherwise) to ensure that this is in fact the same taxon as<em> A. pigra</em>, and in pro of taxonomic stability, Cortés-Ortiz <em>et al</em>. (2015a) continue to call this taxon <em>A. pigra</em> until further studies are completed.Using mtDNA markers, Cortés-Ortiz <em>et al</em>. (2003) confirmed that<em> A. palliata</em> and <em>A. pigra</em> comprise reciprocally monophyletic groups, justifying their separation into distinct species.

Here, we follow Gregorin (2006) in recognizing <em>A. ululata </em>as a distinct species.

Although colour details were mentioned in the type description of <em>H. g. ranomafanensis</em>, their status is impossible to determine because at the same time no such details were given for <em>H. g. griseus</em>; the essence of the new subspecies was, in effect, that it is chromosomally polymorphic at Ranomafana and Ambongo (2n = 54, 55 or 56, whereas in <em>H. g. griseus</em> 2n = always 54), while at Ambolomavo, Bemaraha and Vatoalatsaka, also ascribed to this new subspecies, only 2n=56 occurs. A subspecies apparently based, at least on present evidence, on the occurrence of a polymorphism cannot be maintained (see Mittermeier <em>et al</em>. 2008). Mittermeier <em>et al</em>.

Recent molecular work indicates that the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) population of <em>D</em>. <em>b</em>. <em>minor</em> exhibits lower genetic diversity than the Zimbabwean population, but that these populations were historically connected (Kotzé et al. 2014). However, KZN animals have still bred very well when translocated to new populations elsewhere such as the Eastern Cape and the Zimbabwe Lowveld.

Critically, the “<em>aduncus</em>-type” subpopulations found off South Africa are genetically distinct (reciprocally monophyletic) compared to other populations of similar phenotype from elsewhere in the world (and all currently classified as <em>Tursiops aduncus</em>).<br/><br/>A migratory stock, moving between Plettenberg Bay and Durban in South Africa, was assessed separately to the so-called resident stock (nearshore waters less than 50 m depth from Kosi Bay to Mossel Bay) in the 2004 National Assessment (Friedmann and Daly 2004). This was based on Goodwin <em>et al.</em> (1996) who found significant differentiation of mtDNA haplotypes between Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal individuals. Subsequent genetic studies showed significant differentiation between three putative stocks, although none of these comparisons described more than 3% of the genetic variance (Natoli <em>et al. </em>2008). The identified boundaries distinguished northern and southern ‘resident’ populations either side of Ifafa, and a third ‘migratory’ population, sampled 20 km or more south of the KwaZulu-Natal/Eastern Cape border between June and October, for which the full distribution range is not known. Ongoing work at higher resolution is confirming these population boundaries (Gray 2015). Further research is needed to determine the level of connectivity among other regional populations across the broader distributional range. For this reassessment, although this species was split into a migratory and resident subpopulation in the 2004 assessment, subsequent genetic analyses indicate that the distinction should be between coastal populations north and south of Ifafa, with the role of migratory animals to the south still poorly understood.<br/><br/><u>UAE Taxonomic Note<br/></u>Formerly included in <em>Tursiops truncatus</em> but now regarded as a separate species (Hammond <em>et al</em>. 2012c).

The current taxonomy essentially follows the early revision of Hershkovitz (1983), with some modifications for the Colombian and Central American forms. However, Ruiz-Herrera <em>et al. </em>(2005) reported that cytogenetic studies characterized 18 different karyotypes with diploid numbers ranging from 46 to 58 chromosomes. Recent molecular studies have made valuable contributions towards the understanding of night monkeys’ taxonomy and their phylogenetic relations (Plautz <em>et al. </em>2009, Menezes <em>et al.</em> 2010). <br/><br/>Reviewing the entire taxonomy and distributions of the night monkeys, <em>Aotus</em>, Ford (1994) carried out multivariate analyses of craniodental measures and pelage patterns and colour, and also took into consideration chromosomal data and blood protein variations. Ford (1994) concluded that there was “good support” for just two species north of the Río Amazonas: <em>A. trivirgatus</em> (Humboldt, 1812) east and north of the Rio Negro, and the polymorphic <em>A. vociferans</em> to the west of the Rio Negro. <em>Aotus vociferans</em>, as such, would include all the forms north of the Río Amazonas/Solimões in Brazil (west of the Rio Negro), Peru, Colombia and Ecuador, and in the Chocó, northern Colombia and Colombian Andes, and Panama: <em>brumbacki</em>, <em>lemurinus</em>, <em>griseimembra</em>, and <em>zonalis</em>. <br/> <br/>Hernández-Camacho and Cooper (1976) restricted both <em>lemurinus</em> (Colombian Andes, elevations from 1,000 to 1,500&#160;m up to 3,000-3,200&#160;m) and <em>griseimembra</em> (northern lowlands, Santa Marta mountains, West to Río Sinú, Río San Jorge, lower Río Cauca and lowlands of middle and upper Río Magdalena) to Colombia, while recognizing the form <em>zonalis </em>as the night monkey of north-western Colombia (Chocó) and Panama. Hershkovitz (1983) recognized <em>lemurinus</em> and <em>griseimembra</em> as distinct, but considered them to be subspecies of a single species; he made no mention of the name <em>zonalis</em>, but as he ascribed Central American night monkeys to <em>A. lemurinus lemurinus</em>, by implication he was regarding it as a synonym of this latter form. Groves (2001) followed Hernández-Camacho and Cooper (1976) in recognizing <em>zonalis</em> as the form in Panama, and listed it as a subspecies of <em>lemurinus</em> along with <em>griseimembra</em> and <em>brumbacki</em> Hershkovitz, 1983.

The early classification of spider monkeys proposed by Kellogg and Goldman (1944) relied on the geographical distribution and several morphological characters. However, <em>Ateles belzebuth</em> comprised of several taxa characterized by the presence of a white patch on the forehead, including populations of white-bellied spider monkeys from northwestern Amazonia, the trans-Andean populations of <em>Ateles hybridus</em>, and the populations of spider monkeys from eastern Amazonia (<em>Ateles marginatus</em>). Spider monkeys without a whitish brow patch were also grouped together, including spider monkeys of the Guianas (<em>Ateles paniscus</em>) and spider monkeys from southwestern Amazonia (<em>Ateles chamek</em>). This initial taxonomic hypothesis was not parsimonious due to the geographical discordance between groups of spider monkeys with “similar” characters. In fact, Sampaio <em>et al.</em> (1993) had argued that the forms paniscus and chamek should be considered distinct species on the basis of the genetic distance between them.<br/><br/>The morphological and molecular studies conducted by Froehlich <em>et al.</em> (1991) and by Collins and Dubach (2000), respectively, brought up a new hypothesis that suggested that <em>Ateles belzebuth</em> was composed of three major Amazonian groups (<em>Ateles b. belzebuth, Ateles b. chamek </em>and <em>Ateles b. marginatus</em>), while <em>Ateles paniscus</em> was a sister group (and basal) to all other spider monkeys. Also, these studies provided evidence for an early divergence between <em>Ateles hybridus</em> in northern South America and <em>Ateles belzebuth</em> in the Amazon basin (Collins 1999; Collins and Dubach 2000). Later studies based on chromosomal and molecular markers supported the hypothesis that the <em>belzebuth-chamek-marginatus</em> group formed a monophyletic clade (Nieves <em>et al.</em> 2005). Since then there has been debate on the specific status of <em>belzebuth</em>, <em>chamek</em> and<em> marginatus</em>, and several authors have supported this new classification of Amazonian spider monkeys (e.g. Rylands<em> et al. </em>2000). Recently, a new molecular study proposed that <em>Ateles marginatus</em> may well be the sister taxon to all other spider monkeys, and confirmed that <em>Ateles belzebuth</em> and <em>Ateles chamek</em> are indeed sister taxa that may have shared a common ancestor approximately 1.8 million years ago (Morales-Jimenez <em>et al.</em> 2015)."

The diagnosis characters included the morphology of external genitalia of both sexes, the unpigmented facial skin and pigmented auricular skin, bright orange coloration in the facial skin and genitalia (in natura), and a mantle strongly contrasting with the dorsum and anterior limbs (Silva Júnior and Noronha 1998). <br/>According to Hershkovitz (1977) classification, the<em> Callithrix</em> genus was subdivided into two species groups, <em>C. jacchus</em> group (Atlantic marmoset), and <em>C. argentata</em> group (Amazonian marmoset). In 2000, Rylands and collaborators, based on phylogenetic studies, suggested the <em>Callithrix</em> genus division, proposing the term <em>Callithrix</em> for species living from Atlantic Forest, Caatinga and Cerrado (savanna-like vegetation) and a revalidation of Mico Lesson, 1840 genus to the Amazonian taxa, reinforcing that it is not a paraphyletic genus (Rylands <em>et al.</em> 2000). Groves (2001, 2005) dealt <em>Mico</em> like subgenus. Finally, the study from Rylands <em>et al. </em>(2000) has largely been accepted and used, inclusive in the taxonomy proposed by Rylands (2012), which is succeeding to this work.<br/>The current taxonomy of the <em>Mico</em> genus harbors 14 recognized species: <em>M. humilis, M. argentatus, M. leucippe, M. emiliae, M. melanurus, M. intermedius, M. rondoni, M. nigriceps, M. marcai, M. acariensis, M. mauesi, M. chrysoleucos, M. saterei</em>, and <em>M. humeralifer </em>(Garbino 2014; Rylands and Mittermeier 2013; Schneider <em>et al.</em> 2012). There are few studies addressing phylogenetical relationships within this genus. The unique work that embraces all species is from Garbino (2013), which is a morphology-based phylogeny using 21 species of the Callitrichini tribe. According to Garbino´s cladogram, <em>Mico saterei </em>is a sister-group of <em>M. intermedius</em> sustained by three morphological synapomorphies. The division of the Amazonian marmosets’ taxon into two groups (“with auricular tufts” and “without auricular tufts” - Hershkovitz 1977), is supported by Garbino (2013), but is recognized that such groups are not monophyletic. Thus, <em>M. chrysoleucos, M. humeralifer, M. mauesi, M. saterei</em> and <em>M. humilis </em>belongs to the “with auricular tussock” group. Molecular evidences remain unclear regarding to phylogenetical relationships of <em>M. saterei</em>. For instance, Sena <em>et al.</em> (2002), based on DNA-mitochondrial markers, indicated that <em>M. mauesi, M. melanurus</em> and <em>M. humeralifer</em> are closer taxa to <em>M. saterei</em>. On the other hand, Schneider <em>et al.</em> (2012), using mitochondrial and four nuclear-regions, suggested that <em>M. saterei </em>is included in a higher group composed by <em>M. mauesi </em>and <em>M. humeralifer</em>. Both works, however, focused the relationships among genera (<em>Callithrix, Callibella, Cebuella </em>and<em> Mico</em>) with few species from <em>Mico </em>genus represented.

It was not recognized by Hershkovitz (1977) who regarded it as a dark form of<em> Callithrix argentata</em>. Vivo (1985, 1991) revalidated this form on the basis of specimens from the state of Rondônia. However, Rylands <em>et al.</em> (1993) indicated that the Rondônia marmosets described by Vivo should be considered a distinct form based on the fact that the species’ distribution and that of the <em>Hapale emiliae</em> Thomas, 1904 from Maloca on the Rio Curuá (see Vivo 1985; Ávila Pires 1986) are disjunct, and separated by <em>M. melanurus</em>. That the Rondônia “<em>emiliae</em>” is distinct from <em>emiliae </em>Thomas, 1904 was confirmed by Sena (1998) and Ferrari <em>et al.</em> (1999), who found <em>M. emiliae</em> to be more similar to <em>M. argentatus</em> than the “<em>emiliae</em>” from Rondônia. These authors argue that the Rio Tapajós separates two distinct, very recent, radiations of <em>Mico</em>. Alperin (1995) argued that <em>Mico nigriceps</em> (Ferrari and Lopes 1992) and “<em>emiliae</em>” from Rondônia belong to the same species.

4216,Cercopithecus dryas,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,PRIMATES,MAMMALIA,CERCOPITHECIDAE,Cercopithecus,dryas,,,,,"Schwarz, 1932","<em>Cercopithecus dryas</em> is one of Africa’s least known and most enigmatic monkeys. Its nomenclature has been disputed, and its phylogenetic affinities are uncertain. The type specimen, the skull and skin of a captive juvenile male from the early 1930s, is from an unknown source population in central Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), most likely in the Lomela region in what is currently Sankuru Province (Schwarz 1932). The species was not reported again until 1977, when Kano and Kuroda acquired two hunter-killed animals in the Wamba research area 300 km north of Lomela town (Kuroda <em>et al</em>. 1985). One of these animals became the type specimen for a new species: <em>Cercopithecus salongo </em>Thys van den Audenaerde 1977. Subsequent re-examination of the <em>C. dryas</em> type and Wamba specimen indicated that these represented the same species with age-related differences in colouration, thus sinking <em>salongo </em>into <em>dryas </em>(Colyn <em>et al</em>. 1991). Sarmiento (2002) disputed this assessment. However, the current treatment follows Groves (2001, 2005), Grubb <em>et al</em>. (2003), Butynski (2013), and Healy (2013) in accepting the synonymy of the two forms. Following the collections by Kano and Kuroda, <em>C. dryas </em>was confirmed in the Kokolopori area to the east of Wamba (Lokasola 2008). Lokasola (2008) suggests that Kano and Kuroda’s 1977 specimen likely came from this same population.<br/><br/>In 2014, the species reappeared again, 400 km southeast of Kokolopori/Wamba near Bafundo, in Maniema Province, less than 15 km west of the Congo (Lualaba) River. Field staff from the Lukuru Foundation’s TL2 Project collected photos of a fresh hunter-killed adult female and later collected a hunter-killed adult male from this same area (Hart 2014). Subsequently, the species was seen at two sites ~31 km west of Bafundo near the Lomami River, and two sites ~75 km west of the city of Kindu (Alempijevic <em>et al</em>. 2018). Both sexes of the Lomami-Lualaba interfluve population are characterized by striking rufous cheeks and upper ventrum, a feature not mentioned in the published descriptions of <em>C. dryas sensu lato</em>, as all publications describe specimens with white- or cream-coloured facial hairs and ventrum (Schwarz 1932, Thys van den Audenaerde 1977, Kuroda <em>et al</em>. 1985). Nevertheless, a photo of a monkey taken in 2011 at Iyondji in the Kokolopori/Wamba region by R. Mittermeier clearly shows these animals have rufous cheeks. Subsequently, S. Kuroda (comment posted online in 2016 in Hart 2014) confirmed that his 1977 Wamba specimens looked like the Bafundo animals. Tail colouration, in particular the shape and location of the triangular dark grey ventral patch at the base of the tail, in both sexes, has also been a source of confusion (e.g. <em>C. dryas</em> illustration, Gautier-Hion <em>et al</em>. 1999). The prominent blue perineum and scrotum in adult males (Hart 2014) has not been mentioned in previous published accounts of the species, but this feature likely fades in death, as in <em>C. lomamiensis</em>, and may not be evident in all hunter-killed animals and dry museum skins (Hart <em>et al</em>. 2012). Additional field surveys and population genetics studies are needed to assess the level of variation present among known populations, as this monkey occurs in very small, widely-separated populations over a very large area, and with no evident contact between them.<br/><br/><em>Cercopithecus dryas</em> is currently assigned to its own species group, the <em>Cercopithecus dryas</em>-group (Groves 2001, Butynski 2002), where it is the smallest species within the genus <em>Cercopithecus </em>(Butynski 2013). However, recent phylogenetic analyses based on the mitochondrial genome of the type specimen (finger tip) show <em>C. dryas</em> clustering within the genus <em>Chlorocebus </em>(Guschanski <em>et al</em>. 2013). Groves suggested possible affinities between <em>C. dryas </em>and <em>Chlorocebus </em>after initial assessment of the skin and skull of the type specimen (1972 pers. comm. cited in Thys van den Audenaerde 1977), however he later concluded that <em>C. dryas</em> is a distinct species within the genus <em>Cercopithecus </em>based on the cranial morphology of the type specimen and a photograph of an adult skull in Kuroda <em>et al</em>. (1985). Additional morphological and genetic (nuclear DNA) evidence is needed to resolve <em>C. dryas</em>’ position within the guenon radiation (tribe <em>Cercopithecini</em>)."

Using genetic analyses, Spencer <em>et al</em>. (2001) proposed that <em>Phascogale</em> comprised four distinct lineages: the three groups mentioned above plus <em>P. calura</em>, and inferred that the three taxa within <em>P. tapoatafa</em> be recognised as full species. Later, Soderquist and Rhind (2008) recognised the Northern Territory, but not the Kimberley, population as <em>P. pirata</em>, labelling the Kimberley population as an undescribed subspecies; however no analyses supporting this taxonomy have been published. In this Action Plan, we have followed this taxonomy. M. Westerman <em>et al</em>.

However, it is highly likely that <em>M. angolensis </em>represents a species complex (Simmons 2005, Cotterill, 2001, Monadjem et al., 2010a,b) but a complete review of this taxon has yet to be conducted. A recent study showed that the Cytochrome_b sequences of West African <em>M. angolensis smithii</em> differed by only 1.4-2.1% from that of <em>M. angolensis ruwenzorii</em> in the central Congo basin, suggesting that these two taxa are not specifically distinct. The subspecies <em>goliath</em> was first described by Bergmans (1997) and elevated to species status by Cotterill (2001), based mostly on its larger size and its perceived allopatric distribution. Monadjem et al. (2010a) listed <em>goliath</em> as a valid species, but drew attention to the fact that it was also present in northern Mozambique (Monadjem et al., 2010b) and may therefore possibly be continuous with populations of <em>ruwenzorii</em> in southern Tanzania. The status of <em>goliath</em> needs to be re-evaluated with a molecular approach. The distribution of <em>Myoonycteris angolensis petraea</em> appears to be geniunely allopatric and this taxon may well prove to be a distinct species. The status of the <em>L. angolensis angolensis</em> remains uncertain.</p>  <p>The <em>angolensis</em> species complex was previously listed under the genus <em>Lissonycteris</em>.

44704,Muntiacus truongsonensis,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,CETARTIODACTYLA,MAMMALIA,CERVIDAE,Muntiacus,truongsonensis,,,,,"(Giao, Tuoc, Dung, Wikramanayake, Amato, Arctander &amp; Mackinnon, 1997)","This nominal taxon had a tortured arrival and history. The first available name is <em>Caninmuntiacus truongsonensis</em> [Pham Mong] Giao, [Do] Tuoc, Eric [Wikramanayake], [Vu Van] Dung <em>et al</em>. in Nguyen An Quang Ha, 1997, in a newspaper article. This meets all International Code for Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) criteria for availability (Grubb 2005) and therefore by the ICZN principle of priority must stand as the valid name for this taxon, unless an earlier available name is found. The following year, <em>Muntiacus truongsonensis</em> P.M. Giao, D. Tuoc, V.V. Dung, Wikramanayake, Amato, Arctander and Mackinnon, 1998 was proposed, explicitly as a new name (not as a clarification of the earlier name). This 1998 proposal is certainly based on the same collected material as the 1997 proposal so is a junior objective synonym of the latter. As the species-group name is spelled exactly the same way as in the 1997 proposal, it is also a junior homonym of it. Neither original description allows objective morphological determination of what the name applies to, although mtDNA sequences shared with no previously-named muntjac were isolated from the material collected (P.M. Giao <em>et al</em>. 1998). The 1997 publication indicated no holotype, and gave no details on where the syntypes were or would be lodged. The 1998 publication of the junior synonym named a holotype; Grubb (2005) considered that “technically it is probably a lectotype”. In fact, as the 1998 publication was explicitly proposing a new name, not a reinterpretation of the 1997 name, the holotype designated is indeed the holotype, but of their junior synonym; it could have no bearing on the 1997 name <em>Caninmuntiacus truongsonensis</em>, the senior (and thus valid) name for this group, unless an explicit nomenclatural act were to associate the specimen with that name, as a lectotype (there appears no doubt that the 1998 holotype is from the syntype series in the 1997 original description). Such an act would be unwise, because the specimen may not now be traceable, and in any case is not known to have been the source of the DNA result and it has no pelage associated with it, nor might it be a complete skull with all relevant diagnostic features present. Therefore, to make this single specimen the name-bearing type would handicap progress in resolving this name’s applicability and if it were found to have different DNA, would firmly install even more confusion. Nomenclatural stability, and thus conservation, would best be served by designating as a neotype a specimen (ideally full skeletal and pelt) lodged in a named internationally accessible collection with long-term storage facilities, which shares the exact genetic sequence provided in the 1998 description of the junior synonym. There is currently no known specimen suitable for this course of events.  <br/> <br/>Some of the biological material referred to in the articles of Nguyen An Quang Ha (1997) and P.M. Giao <em>et al</em>. (1998) was shown in 1998 to R.J. Timmins (pers. comm. 2008) by Do Tuoc in the collections of the Forest Inventory and Planning Institute, Hanoi. This material, consisting entirely of damaged skulls and mandibles, is poorly, although distinctively, labelled. Part of the explanation for the confusion over application of the name results from it including at least two species: one or more taxa in the <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> species-complex and one specimen of northern red muntjac <em>M. vaginalis</em>. The three specimens illustrated in Nguyen An Quang Ha (1997) and several other newspapers and magazines were not present in this FIPI collection. Several years later, R.J. Timmins (pers. comm. 2008) came across them in the WWF offices in Hanoi, where they appear to have been since 1997. None of either the FIPI or WWF material is labelled as any form of type, or has the markings as described in P.M. Giao <em>et al</em>. (1998). Until a lectotype or neotype of <em>C. truongsonensis</em> P.M. Giao <em>et al</em>. in Nguyen An Quang Ha, 1997 is established in an explicit nomenclatural act, it is not possible to begin to determine the diagnostic morphological characters of <em>M. truongsonensis</em>. Until such an act it is only speculation whether any or all of the pelage characters or the mtDNA sequences given by P.M. Giao <em>et al</em>. (1998) and Amato <em>et al</em>. (1999a, 1999b, 2000), or the skull characteristics of some of the FIPI and WWF material which appear to be significantly different from <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008), in fact are those of <em>M. truongsonensis</em>, although with appropriate typification, they could probably be made to be. This uncertainty is because it is effectively impossible that all syntypes (comprising, as they do, 2–3 species) would share the same mtDNA or pelage features with each other, and they certainly do not share skull features. It is not clear whether the genetic analysis of the 1998 publication included the 1998 holotype (for which, as argued above, it would not be sensible to propose formally as the lectotype of the 1997 name), although it seems a reasonable inference that it involved the 1997 syntypes. Until a lectotype or neotype of the 1997 name is selected, it is not possible to assess the possibility that gene sequences published in P.M. Giao <em>et al</em>. (1998), and Amato <em>et al</em>. (1999a, 1999b, 2000), could actually refer to a taxon different from those skulls within the syntype series with obviously novel morphological characteristics (which were not discussed in either the 1997 or 1998 publications). This possibility is real, although slight, because of the presence of at least two apparently species-level taxa within the syntype series and the fairly likely sympatric occurrence of <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> with the taxon generally taken to be represented by the name <em>M. truongsonensis</em>, or even the possibility of a closely similar taxon (perhaps <em>M. puhoatensis</em>). <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> is morphologically very similar to material currently assumed to represent <em>M. truongsonensis</em>, and an animal very similar in skull and pelage features to the holotype of <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> has been recorded from the Xe Sap NPA area of Lao PDR, very close to the type locality of <em>M. truongsonensis</em> (R.J. Timmins pers. obs. based on material collected by R. Steinmetz and Tanya Chanard). As of November 2015, following visits to both FIPI and the WWF Hanoi offices, it appears that all of the original type material of <em>M. truongsonensis</em> has now been lost (R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2015).<br/> <br/>Although morphological characteristics cannot, therefore, be objectively defined for the presumed taxon to which the name <em>M. truongsonensis</em> is being applied there exist various specimens very similar to, but obviously different from, <em>M. rooseveltorum</em>. These have generally dark rather than brown or reddish pelage, a tail that is blackish dorsally and long premaxillae that contact the nasals rather than short premaxillae that do not. These are taken here provisionally to represent <em>M. truongsonensis</em> (in the hope that this morphologically-defined group will be found to correspond to the novel genetic sequence of P.M. Giao <em>et al</em>. 1998, and that appropriate typification could cement this hypothesis). However, there is still considerable variation in these morphological traits within available Indochinese specimens of the <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> complex, and some animals show character states apparently intermediate between <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> and '<em>M. truongsonensis</em>'. It is not clear whether these represent hybrids or indicate that intraspecific variation is wide enough to blur interspecific variation, because very few complete specimens are available for which congruence between morphological traits can be compared: in fact out of over 50 specimens of this complex from Lao PDR and Viet Nam, R.J. Timmins (pers. comm. 2008) is only aware of two complete specimens, in which both skull and pelage features can be fully documented, the holotype of <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> and a female collected by R. Steinmetz and Tanya Chanard from the Xe Sap NPA area of Lao PDR. <br/> <br/>See also <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> for further complications concerning this species-complex."

Specific doubts concern subspecies number and evolution of subspecies into species. Cabrera (1961) considered there to be nine subspecies (<em>M. a. gualea, M. a. jucunda, M. a. rosii, M. a. rufa, M. a. sarae, M. a. sheila, M. a. whitelyi, M. a. zamora</em> and <em>M. a. zetta</em>).  Czernay (1987) added the following six subspecies to Cabrera's list: <em> M. a. temama, M. a. cerasina, M. a. reperticia, M. a. americana, M. a. trinitatis</em> and <em>M. a. carrikeri</em>. On the other hand, Thomas (1913) considered <em>M. zetta</em> and <em>M. sheila</em> as species and not subspecies. Allen (1915) corroborated Thomas, and added <em>M. trinitatis, M. rufa, M. sartorii, M. gualea, M. fuscata</em> and <em>M. zamora</em> as species.  <em>M. temama</em>, earlier considered as a subspecies, was reclassified as a separate species by Groves and Grubb (1987), based on cytogenetical studies carried out by other authors. Rossi (2000) did a taxonomic revision of the <em>Mazama</em> genus for Brazil. He did not observe differences between <em>Mazama americana</em> specimens collected from different regions. Cytogenetic analysis of <em>M. americana</em> was initially realized by Taylor <em>et al.</em> (1969), who reported 2n-68 and NF=74. Jorge and Bernirschke (1977) analyzed three <em>M. americana temama</em> and described their basic karyotype as 2n=50 and FN=70, with a chromosome fusion in one of the studied animals. The X chromosome was submetacentric and approximately the same size as chromosome pair 7. The metacentric Y was the smallest chromosome. The vast differences among the animals analyzed by Jorge and Benirschke (1977) and Taylor <em>et al.</em> (1969) raised questions concerning these species’ classification. Neitzel (1987) analyzed a Paraguayan female and described yet another pattern for the species.  It had 2n=52, plus 4 to 5 B chromosomes and NF=56. The submetacentric X was the largest chromosome. These results increased doubts as to this species’ karyotypic pattern. More recently, Duarte (1992) analyzed four Brazilian animals, and obtained conflicting results.  Diploid numbers were 48, 50, 52 and 54, and NF = 54, 54, 56 and 56, respectively. These results were similar to those obtained by Neitzel (1987).  According to Duarte and Merino (1997), this polymorphism appears to indicate the existence of various species within the Red Brocket Deer."

There is still some debate surrounding whether Moose comprise one or two species. Groves and Grubb (1987) called them ""semi-species"". Boeskorov (1997) proposed that the chromosomal races of <em>Alces alces </em>were different species, however, Bowyer <em>et al.</em> (2000) cautioned that chromosome numbers might be a poor designator of species among large mammals. Based on cited sources that documented differences between Eurasian Elk and Moose, Geist (1998) recommended separation at the subspecies level (i.e., <em>Alces alces alces</em> Linneaus, 1758 and <em>Alces alces americanus</em> Clinton, 1822). Geist (1998) noted a broad zone of hybridization between the two forms in central and eastern Siberia but Boeskorov (2003) identifies the Yenisei River as the boundary between the ranges of the two putative species. There are no differences in antler morphology on either side of the river, however, suggesting substantial gene flow (Kolesnikov and Kozlovskii 2014). Moreover, genetic analyses have generally supported distinguishing the two at the subspecific level (Hundertmark <em>et al.</em> 2002 a,b; Udina <em>et al.</em> 2002; Hundertmark and Bowyer 2004); further research is needed before a consensus would support species-level classification.<br/><br/>Hundertmark <em>et al.</em> (2002b) report that analysis of mtDNA revealed three haplogroups, one entirely Asian, one primarily European and one primarily North American.

Assignment of the name to an external morphological diagnosis is problematic because the holotype is an incomplete skull (male) and therefore only those skull characters observable on this specimen are objectively known to be those of the species. Assignment of any further characters, including all relating to pelage, relies on subjective association of other specimens with the name. Although it is almost always justified to assume that a series of specimens of the same general type from the same general area do comprise one species, the confusion into which such assumptions have pitched understanding of muntjac status in Lao PDR and Viet Nam, and the apparent sympatry of two or more species within the <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> species-complex within this same area, urges a precautionary approach here. Caution is further indicated by results from camera-trapping in and around the type locality, which suggests on the basis of pelage features that there may be more than one species within the <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> species-complex in the general area (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008 based on WCS unpublished data). Such sympatry would explain certain incongruities such as Rabinowitz <em>et al</em>. (1999) apparently having measured, from the same general area, the skulls of a slightly larger form with short premaxillae that are separated from the nasals, as well as the seemingly smaller specimens of the type series which have long premaxillae that contact the nasals (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008 based on type material in ANNH, Rabinowitz <em>et al</em>. 1999). The premaxilla length seems to separate the two nominal species of <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> and <em>M. truongsonensis</em> in Lao PDR and Viet Nam, indicating that, since both character-states are apparently present in northern Myanmar, there may be two species there, too (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). The assumption has been made (including by the original describers) that the name <em>M. putaoensis</em> applies to the animals with a red pelage similar in tone to <em>M. vaginalis</em>, but differing in characters of the head pelage. This however needs additional research to investigate the concordance of skulls showing features of the holotype with their associated pelage characteristics (see above). Camera-trap photographs showing the external diagnostic head-pelage characters alluded to above are taken here as provisionally referring to <em>M. putaoensis</em>. Statements about the species' conservation status hinge on whether the skull-based name <em>M. putaoensis</em> conforms to this suite of pelage characters.<br/><br/>It is also possible that some claims of the species based solely on morphological characteristics might actually refer to <em>M. gongshanensis</em> which is morphologically very similar (R.J.

No recent reviewer (e.g. Ma <em>et al</em>. 1986, Grubb 1977, Groves and Grubb 1990) appears to have examined the holotype; even Grubb (1977) had only photographs of the skull on which to work (P. Grubb pers. comm. to R.J. Timmins, 1997). However, with the recent discovery of several muntjac species in nearby parts of southeast Asia, re-examination of the <em>M. feae</em> holotype is needed, to clarify the species' diagnostic characters, and to verify that captive animals in various Thai collections (including the Dusit Zoo) and a few specimens in the Natural History Museum, London (particularly # 24.1.6.2) truly are <em>M. feae</em> (Grubb 1977, Groves and Grubb 1990).<br/> <br/>Groves and Grubb (1990) included, within <em>M. feae</em>, two taxa now known to be different species: <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> and <em>M. gongshanensis</em>. <em>M. feae</em> has also been claimed for eastern Tibet (Xizang autonomous region) and southwestern China (Yunnan Province) (Zhang <em>et al</em>. 1984, Sokolov 1957, Ma <em>et al</em>. 1986). Groves and Grubb (1990) grouped various specimens from this area and northern Myanmar with <em>M. feae</em>, in part pending description of a new taxon that was in progress. Ma <em>et al</em>. (1990) described this new taxon, <em>M. gongshanensis</em>, to which some of the past claims of <em>M. feae</em> can probably be attributed (e.g. material in the NHM, London and the FMNH, Chicago, USA). Although several records refer to <em>M. gongshanensis</em>, some literature records (e.g. Zhang <em>et al</em>. 1984; Sokolov 1957) are best treated as unidentifiable <em>Muntiacus</em> sp. because diagnostic details, based on the current understanding of muntjac systematics, are not available. <em>M. feae</em> is still routinely included in the mammalian fauna of China, often without mention of <em>M. gongshanensis</em> (e.g. Sheng and Lu 1990, Zhang 1997, Sheng 1998, Sheng <em>et al</em>. 1999, Wang 2003). The Kunming Institute of Zoology holds several specimens from China labelled as <em>M. feae</em> (W.G. Robichaud <em>in litt.</em>. 1997 to R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Huang <em>et al</em>. (2006) provided data on the karyotype of '<em>M. feae</em>' but gave the source of the tissues analysed only as fibroblast cell lines of a male <em>M. feae</em> (KCB 91006) that came from the Kunming Cell Bank. If such a cell line was established from a wild-caught animal in China, then it gives considerable support to the presence of <em>M. feae</em> (or a very similar taxon) in southern China, given the apparent similarity of the Huang <em>et al</em>. (2006) karyotype with that of the <em>M. feae</em> karyotype published by Soma <em>et al</em>. (1987) and Tanomtong <em>et al.</em> (2005), which was based on animals from Thailand. However for the purposes of this assessment, the purported distribution in China is considered hypothetical.<br/> <br/>Tortonese (in Grubb 1977) proposed that the correct spelling of the specific name should be <em>M. feai</em> and not <em>M. feae</em>. However, this is not so (Brandon-Jones <em>et al</em>. 2007, Dubois 2007): the correct original spelling of <em>feae</em> should be used, as it was by Corbet and Hill (1992) and Grubb (2005)."
13928,Muntiacus rooseveltorum,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,CETARTIODACTYLA,MAMMALIA,CERVIDAE,Muntiacus,rooseveltorum,,,,,"Osgood, 1932","The taxonomic status of <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> has been controversial for over 60 years, and the species was even relegated by Groves and Grubb (1990) to the synonymy of <em>M. feae</em>. However, genetic analysis of the holotype (Amato <em>et al.</em> 1999a,b, 2000; Le <em>et al.</em> 2014a) and morphological investigations (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2015) confirm the species' validity with respect to all previously-named taxa. More complex is its relationship with several subsequently proposed names, <em>M. truongsonensis</em>, <em>M. putaoensis</em>, and <em>M. puhoatensis</em>. <br/><br/><em>M. rooseveltorum</em> forms a clade with <em>M. truongsonensis</em> and <em>M. putaoensis</em> supported genetically (Amato <em>et al.</em> 1999b, 2000; James <em>et al.</em> 2008; Le <em>et al.</em> 2014 a, b) and morphologically, by the presence of the combination of well developed canines in females and small, generally unbranched, but regularly shed, antlers in males (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). The nominal taxon <em>M. puhoatensis</em> is also very likely to belong to this clade (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). It is still unclear how many species-level taxa there are in this clade, here referred to as the <em>M. r</em>ooseveltorum species-complex (because <em>rooseveltorum </em>is the earliest available name within the complex). At present, diagnostic characters for individual taxa are limited to base sequences of four genes, although for <em>M. puhoatensis</em> even this is not available (Amato <em>et al.</em> 1999b, 2000); the dangers inherent in using mtDNA data to determine taxonomic and phylogenetic relationships among closely related populations urge caution in drawing firm conclusions without establishing congruence with variation of nuclear DNA (both autosomal and Y-chromosome) and morphological characters (Ballard and Whitlock 2004). No such analysis has been performed within this species-complex. Neither the congruence of various morphological features speculated to be important in identifying species within this complex, nor the variation in each character within each apparent species, have been analysed: too few specimens exist for such an analysis. Specimens are particularly few, which allow the full set of skull and pelage characters to be assessed, and where skull and skin are known to be from the same original animal. The accounts for <em>M. truongsonensis</em> and <em>M. puhoatensis</em> (described from one frontlet [antlers and a bit of the skull] lacking any morphological characteristics likely to be necessary for species diagnosis within this species-complex) consider some linked taxonomic and nomenclatorial ambiguities specific to the application of those two names which in turn affect application of the name <em>M. rooseveltorum</em>. Synonymy of either or both <em>M. truongsonensis</em> and <em>M. puhoatensis</em> with <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> cannot be ruled out, although one or both could be valid species. <br/><br/>Le <em>et al.</em> (2014a) reported <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> from the Pu Hoat and Xuan Lien Nature Reserves of Vietnam on the basis of the 16s mitochondrial gene, analysed from four specimens; the paper also claimed to have confirmed the identification on the basis of other mitochondrial genes and nuclear genes, but these apparently have never been determined for the <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> holotype, and furthermore the paper presents no data to support the claim that nuclear genes provide taxonomic resolution of the sampled specimens’ identities. Le <em>et al.</em> (2014 b) report nine cytochrome b sequences from samples collected in Xuan Lien NR as analogous to <em>M. rooseveltorum. </em>Neither paper lists actual details of the sources of their sequences, and the sample numbers given in each paper follow different formats, leaving it uncertain as to whether some of the samples are common to both studies. The reported locality of the Pu Hoat samples however is close to if not the same as the type locality of <em>M. puhoatensis</em>, a species undiagnosable at present because the type material is fragmentary, lacking any known diagnostic features, and has also never been genetically analysed with certainty (Minh Le Duc pers. comm. 2015, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2015). Two relatively complete muntjac specimens from the <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> species-complex from the Pu Hoat region seen by R.J. Timmins (pers. comm. 2015) had several morphological characteristics at variance with the holotype of <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> suggesting that the identification of muntjac specimens from the Pu Hoat region should be taken with care, until identification can be corroborated by additional evidence including morphology and nuclear DNA (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2015). Several popular media articles that reported the findings of Le <em>et al.</em> (2014) also included camera-trap photographs from Xuan Lien Nature Reserve purported to show <em>M. rooseveltorum</em>; however the muntjacs visible in these photographs were either certainly identifiable as <em>M. vaginalis</em> or unidentifiable to species as they lacked visible diagnostic characteristics.<br/><br/>The animals of northern Myanmar taken to be <em>M. putaoensis</em> shows pelage similarities to <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> sensu stricto, specifically reduced dark frontal stripes, short rather than long crown hair tuft and generally rather uniform, and pale, body and tail pelage. There are several camera-trap photographs of animals from Lao PDR and Viet Nam (outside the presumed range of <em>M. putaoensis</em>) of <em>M. rooseveltorum</em>-type animals which show pelage of pale sandy brown to darker orange similar to that shown by animals of northern Myanmar believed to be <em>M. putaoensis </em>(R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). <em>M. putaoensis</em> is generally assumed to be geographically isolated from<em> M. rooseveltorum</em>, and current known localities are indeed widely disjunct. However, the lack of known specimens in intervening areas would be expected given the paucity of suitable surveys. The Mekong is a geographical barrier to some mammals (e.g. squirrels; Timmins and Duckworth 2008), but not others, especially geographically and altitudinally wider ranging taxa in the northern highlands north to the headwater areas of China (e.g. the gibbon <em>Hylobates </em>(<em>Nomascus</em>) <em>leucogenys</em>). Given its altitudinal and geographic range, <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> is likely to belong in the latter category. <br/><br/>These uncertainties mean that <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> can be considered to be currently known only with certainty from the holotype. One further specimen from the Xe Sap National Protected Area of South Laos with skin and skull is very likely to belong to this species (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008 based on material collected by R. Steinmetz and Tanya Chanard). A number of other specimens (poorly documented with respect to morphological features and in the case of Lao specimens also provenance) which have been reported to share the same mitochondrial DNA sequences as the holotype (Amato <em>et al.</em> 1999a; Le <em>et al.</em> 2014 a,b) are also likely to belong to the species, but two closely related species might not be diagnosable with respect to their mtDNA (Ballard and Whitlock 2004), as exemplified by the analogous case of <em>M. gongshanensis</em> and <em>M. crinifrons</em> (see Red List account for <em>M. gongshanensis</em>). Numerous camera-trap photographs from several sites in both Laos and Vietnam show features consistent with the Holotype, yet because of the cautions as laid out above it is best to treat these as only provisional records of the species at present.<br/><br/>Würster-Hill and Seidel (1985) claimed to have analysed the karyotype of <em>M. rooseveltorum</em>, but given the lack of information on the source of their specimen and the means by which it was identified as <em>M. rooseveltorum</em>, and the similarities in karyotype with northern red muntjac <em>M. vaginalis</em>, it has generally been assumed that their tissue originated from a specimen of <em>M. vaginalis</em> (e.g., Groves and Grubb 1990). <br/><br/>Ma <em>et al.</em> (1986) listed <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> for China (seemingly for the first time) with the following statement '<em>M. lachrymans</em> teesdalei described by Lydekker (1915) as having relatively small preorbital pit and premaxillae separated from nasals should be <em>M. rooseveltorum</em>'. Although Lydekker's animal is definitely <em>M. reevesi</em>, Ma <em>et al.</em> (1986) were correct in <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> having the said features. Thus, some records identified as <em>M. reevesi</em> teesdalei in southern China may in fact not be of that taxon and could, given the features of this 1986 description, refer to animals of the <em>M. rooseveltorum </em>complex. Presence of the species-complex in southern China is extremely likely as specimens and photographs of animals in the <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> complex in both Lao PDR and Viet Nam have been obtained close to the Chinese border (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2015). Ma <em>et al.</em> (1986) also identified four purchased skins of this species in the Kunming Institute of Zoology as this species, but the identification was revised to <em>M. reevesi </em>by Groves and Grubb (1990) who apparently examined the four skins in the Kunming Institute of Zoology. There is no description of the skins in the above sources, and given the current understanding of muntjac systematics it would likely be hard to diagnose the specific identity of the skins (especially if heads and tails were incomplete or missing) without molecular analysis, their species identity is thus probably best treated as indeterminate at present. <br/><br/>The English name Roosevelt’s Muntjac is often used, but the scientific name is in the genitive plural, and the original account (Osgood 1932) makes clear that both Theodore and Kermit Roosevelt are to be commemorated. Hence, the appropriate English name is Roosevelts’ Muntjac."
13926,Muntiacus gongshanensis,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,CETARTIODACTYLA,MAMMALIA,CERVIDAE,Muntiacus,gongshanensis,,,,,"Ma in Ma, Wang &amp; Shi, 1990","Existing literature is inconsistent regarding the species of muntjac, additional to Northern Red Muntjac <em>M. vaginalis</em>, in eastern Tibet and Yunnan Province (southwestern China) and northern Myanmar, with reports of <em>M. feae</em> (Zhang <em>et al</em>. 1984, Ma <em>et al</em>. 1986), <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> (Ma <em>et al</em>. 1986) and <em>M. reevesi</em> (Groves and Grubb 1990) made. In all cases identification criteria remain equivocal and are often not stated. Ma (in Ma <em>et al</em>. 1990) described a new species from this region, <em>M. gongshanensis</em>, to which some past claims of the aforementioned other species can probably be attributed. More recently, <em>M. crinifrons</em> has also been said to occur in this area, which lies far from its generally accepted range (in south-east China; e.g. Lu and Sheng 1984), but this stems entirely from a decision, based upon a similarity of analysed portions of mtDNA, to consider <em>M. gongshanensis</em> indistinguishable from, and therefore a junior synonym of, <em>M. crinifrons</em>, rather than any evidence that <em>M. crinifrons</em>, and specifically not <em>M. gongshanensis</em>, is in the region. The first report was from north Myanmar (Rabinowitz <em>et al</em>. 1998; Amato <em>et al</em>. 1999b, 2000), which led to this claim that <em>M. gongshanensis</em> is indistinguishable from <em>M. crinifrons</em>; but to thereby consider the two as synonymous ignores the cautions and dangers of relying solely upon mtDNA to determine species phylogenies and identifications (see Ballard and Whitlock 2004, and references therein). Specifically, no consideration was given to possibilities that non-conspecific populations might possess very similar, perhaps identical, mtDNA, although there are several reasons why they sometimes do so (Ballard and Whitlock 2004). There are subsequent reports of muntjacs under the name '<em>M. crinifrons</em>' from areas of China adjacent to north Myanmar and some way to the west (Schaller and Rabinowitz 2004, Chen <em>et al</em>. 2007). The identification in Chen <em>et al</em>. (2007) was based explicitly solely on mtDNA and <em>M. gongshanensis</em> may not have been considered (the name <em>M. gongshanensis</em> was associated with the name 'Roosevelt’s Muntjak' [sic], for which the code 'Mgon'; was used; yet no result was given anywhere for 'Mgon', nor is either species discussed); Schaller and Rabinowitz (2004) simply took <em>M. gongshanensis</em> as a synonym of <em>M. crinifrons</em>. Therefore, none of these identifications can be taken as indicative of <em>M. crinifrons</em>, if <em>M. gongshanensis</em> is considered a distinct species (as it is here).<br/> <br/>There is no compelling evidence to treat <em>M. gongshanensis</em> and <em>M. crinifrons</em> as conspecific: the two differ substantially in morphological characters (Ma <em>et al</em>. 1990, Groves and Grubb 1990, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008), reportedly also in karyotype (Huang <em>et al</em>. 2006) and even in mtDNA (Lan <em>et al</em>. 1995, Wang Wen and Lan Hong 2000). Nor, because none of the recent records from the region has explicitly identified <em>M. crinifrons</em> as distinct from <em>M. gongshanensis</em> using any of these features, is there even the most slender of reasons to consider that <em>M. crinifrons</em> occurs in the region in addition to <em>M. gongshanensis</em>. All available specimens of this sort of muntjac from Myanmar at the Natural History Museum (London; NHM) and the Field Museum (Chicago, USA; FMNH) and camera-trap photographs (WCS Myanmar Programme unpublished data) with diagnostic characters visible agree with the type material of <em>M. gongshanensis</em> as assessed by R.J. Timmins (pers. comm. 2008), using data on <em>M. gongshanensis</em> types provided by W.G. Robichaud during a visit to the Kunming Institute of Zoology (Yunnan, China) and from images of the holotype shortly after capture supplied by Lan Hong. These Myanmar records are all treated here as being of <em>M. gongshanensis</em>. Over most of the wider area very little camera trapping has been carried out and specimens are not available; so it cannot be excluded that additional muntjac taxa occur, potentially even perhaps <em>M. crinifrons</em> itself.  <br/> <br/>Several authors have listed <em>M. feae</em> for eastern Tibet (Xizang autonomous region) and southwestern China (Yunnan Province) (Zhang <em>et al</em>. 1984, Sokolov 1957, Ma <em>et al</em>. 1986), and Groves and Grubb (1990) grouped various specimens from this area and northern Myanmar (most likely to be <em>M. gongshanensis</em> on current taxonomy) with <em>M. feae</em> pending description of a new taxon, which they were aware was soon to be forthcoming (i.e. <em>M. gongshanensis</em>). The Kunming Institute of Zoology also has several specimens from this area labelled as <em>M. feae</em> (W.G. Robichaud <em>in litt.</em> to R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Although several of these records refer clearly to <em>M. gongshanensis</em>, some others (e.g. Zhang <em>et al</em>. 1984, Sokolov 1957, Wirth and Groves 1988) are probably still better treated as unidentifiable <em>Muntiacus</em> sp. because diagnostic details, based on the current understanding of muntjac systematics, are not available. <em>M. feae</em> is still, however, routinely included in the mammalian fauna of China, often without mention of <em>M. gongshanensis</em> (e.g. Zhang <em>et al</em>. 1997, Sheng <em>et al</em>. 1999).<br/><br/>Presumed NHM and FMNH specimens of <em>M. gongshanensis </em>from Myanmar were seemingly identified as “Chinese Muntjac” by Dollman (1932). Grubb (2005) considered the skin from Tang Me in Po Me, Tibet, described by Bailey (1914, 1915) as “<em>M. [reevesi] lacrymans</em>” to represent <em>M. gongshanensis</em>, however in view of the potential similarity of the species with other species it would be better to consider this skin of uncertain specific affinity."

Genetic analyses of European Roe deer in Poland suggests that Siberian haplotypes are of ancient origin (they were not detected within the modern range of Siberian Roe Deer) and that genetic introgression occurred as the range of Siberian Roe Deer expanded as far west as Central Europe, and European Roe Deer spread east from western refugia during the last glacial maximum (Lorenzini <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014, Matosiuk <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014). As well or instead of introgression into western Roe, it is possible that Siberian Roe had a more western distribution during the Late Peistocene and may even have gone undetected until today, coexisting with European Roe Deer, further evidence is needed to determine the taxonomic identity of the roes in these parts of Europe that bear Siberian-type mtDNA."

136293,Muntiacus puhoatensis,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,CETARTIODACTYLA,MAMMALIA,CERVIDAE,Muntiacus,puhoatensis,,,,,"Trai in Binh Chau, 1997","This species was accidentally described in a magazine article (Binh Chau 1997), based on material collected by Le Trong Trai from the Pu Hoat (mountain) region, in Hanh Dich Village, Hanh Dich Commune, Que Phong District, Nghe An Province, Viet Nam. The original material collected in October 1997 consisted of a single trophy frontlet with antlers (Le Trong Trai pers. comm. to R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Other specimens of small muntjacs were subsequently collected in the same area by Le Trong Trai and Do Tuoc, consisting of further trophy frontlets, tails and two nearly complete specimens (Le Trong Trai and Do Tuoc pers. comm. to R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). A sample of tissue (reportedly from the initial trophy) was sent to P. Arctander (Le Trong Trai pers. comm. to R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008), and this appears to be basis for the claim made by P.M. Giao <em>et al</em>. (1998) of a new undescribed species of muntjac in Viet Nam. However, G. Amato (pers. comm. to R.J. Timmins 1998) was sent a partial sequence by P. Arctander, which he assumes was the sequence used as the basis for the latter claim of P.M. Giao <em>et al</em>. (1998). This sequence was intraspecifically comparable to that of <em>M. rooseveltorum</em>. If this sequence did in fact come from Le Trong Trai's material, specifically from the holotype, and bearing in mind that two species might have similar mtDNA (see Ballard and Whitlock 2004), <em>M. puhoatensis</em> may therefore be a junior subjective synonym of <em>M. rooseveltorum</em>. The tails do not belong to <em>M. vaginalis</em> and the trophies and two near-complete specimens correspond with the <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> complex (which includes also <em>M. truongsonensis</em> and <em>M. putaoensis</em>). Further morphological determination is not possible, because application of the name <em>M. puhoatensis</em>. can only be determined by reference to the holotype, which lacks morphological features for determination within the <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> species-complex, the other material from around the type locality cannot be assumed necessarily to come from the same species as the holotype because species within the <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> complex appear to be sympatric in parts of Lao PDR and Viet Nam (see <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> Red List account). Conservative reasoning suggests taking <em>M. puhoatensis</em> as synonymous with either <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> or <em>M. truongsonensis</em> (which was described a few weeks earlier) until otherwise proven different. Because it is not possible to determine with which of those it should be aligned, it is here kept distinct. See the <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> Red List account for a fuller description of taxonomic issues in this species complex. Le <em>et al.</em> (2014a) reported <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> from the Pu Hoat and Xuan Lien Nature Reserves of Vietnam on the basis of the 16s mitochondrial gene, analysed from four specimens, the paper also claimed to have confirmed the identification on the basis of other mitochondrial genes and nuclear genes, but these apparently have never been determined for the <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> holotype, and furthermore the paper presents no data to support the claim that nuclear genes provide taxonomic resolution of the sampled specimens’ identities. Le <em>et al.</em> (2014 b) report nine cytochrome b sequences from samples collected in Xuan Lien NR as analogous to <em>M. rooseveltorum</em>. Neither paper lists actual details of the sources of their sequences, and the sample numbers given in each paper follow different formats, leaving it uncertain as to whether some of the samples are common to both studies. The reported locality of the Pu Hoat samples however is close to if not the same as the type locality of <em>M. puhoatensis</em>, a species undiagnosable at present because the type material is fragmentary, lacking any known diagnostic features, and has also never been genetically analysed with certainty (Minh Le Duc pers. comm. 2015, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2015). Two relatively complete muntjac specimens from the <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> species-complex from the Pu Hoat region seen by R.J. Timmins (pers. comm. 2015) had several morphological characteristics at variance with the holotype of <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> suggesting that the identification of muntjac specimens from the Pu Hoat region should be taken with care, until identification can be corroborated by additional evidence including morphology and nuclear DNA (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2015). Several popular media articles that reported the findings of Le <em>et al.</em> (2014) also included camera-trap photographs from Xuan Lien Nature Reserve purported to show <em>M. rooseveltorum</em>, however the muntjacs visible in these photographs were either certainly identifiable as <em>M. vaginalis</em> or unidentifiable to species as they lacked visible diagnostic characteristics."

136551,Muntiacus vaginalis,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,CETARTIODACTYLA,MAMMALIA,CERVIDAE,Muntiacus,vaginalis,,,,,"(Boddaert, 1785)","Taxonomic Notes:&#160;&#160; &#160;Groves (2003) elected to raise non-Sundaic forms of <em>M. muntjak</em> (<em>s.l.</em>) from subspecific taxa to the species <em>M. vaginalis</em>, leaving the Sundaic forms to constitute <em>M. muntjak</em> (<em>s.s.</em>). In 2008 the IUCN Red List chose to follow this split, with the following caveats. This position, already postulated by previous authors (e.g. Groves and Grubb 1990), rests on little evidence, primarily the assumption that all taxa within M. muntjak in the Sunda region carry a unique karyotype different from all <em>M. vaginalis</em> in northern regions. However, the Sundaic karyotype seems to have been documented in only a few individuals from the Malay Peninsula south of the Isthmus of Kra (Wurster and Aitkin 1972, Groves and Grubb 1990, Groves 2003, Tanomtong <em>et al.</em> 2005), assumed to be <em>M. muntjak</em> (the type locality of the later is Java). Other purported differences (e.g. dorsal darkening and short nasals, Groves 2003, Groves and Grubb 1990), if they can be considered diagnostic characters rather than traits (see below), appear minor rather than ones likely to separate species-level taxa. Although differences in chromosome number between muntjacs appears likely to constitute a good species boundary, preventing extensive interbreeding (see Groves and Grubb 1990), a much wider sampling of karyotype (especially within the presumed range of <em>M. muntjak</em> (<em>s.s.</em>)) is needed to place on solid ground the systematic position which assumes separate and widespread ranges for the two so far identified karyotypes. There appears to have been no significant further investigation of this taxonomic split since 2008, and thus the 2014 reassessment largely for the sake of status quo maintains this taxonomic treatment.<br/><br/>Groves (2003) and other authors (e.g., P.M. Giao <em>et al.</em> 1998) have suggested that northern forms here placed within<em> M. vaginalis</em> may constitute more than one species, and Groves and Grubb (2011) separated the taxon into four species, <em>M. vaginalis s.s.</em> (central range, the most widespread of the four), M. malabaricus (extreme southwest of range), M. aureus (western range with an outlier in the central part of the range) and <em>M. nigripes</em> (eastern parts of the range). The purported differences between these taxa include body size, antler size and general and or midback, nape and crown pelage colour and or more specifically its darkness. The purported descriptions presumably meant to indicate diagnostic differences and the grounds for considering the species valid are often internally inconsistent, for example “shorter antlers” is clearly implied as a characteristic of <em>M. vaginalis</em>, <em>M. malabaricus </em>is stated to have “shorter antlers [than <em>M. vaginalis</em>]”, in<em> M. aureus </em>the “antlers short” and in <em>M. nigripes</em> once again “antlers short”. Specimens used and sample sizes are not given, nor is there in general any discussion of variation, nor reference to alternative explanations for the geographical distribution of traits. With the obvious propensity for muntjacs to undergo chromosome rearrangements, and the clear indications from certain areas of multiple sympatric and or closely parapatric muntjac species, it is clearly quite possible (perhaps even probable) that <em>M. vaginalis</em> as used here may involve multiple phylogenetic species. However the documentation of such species, especially for the sake of taxonomic stability, requires the burden of proof to be placed on those authors attempting taxonomic splits. For the reasons already outlined, small sample sizes (morphological or genetic) from disparate range locations are not adequate proof, for such a widespread, ecologically tolerant species, that effective reproductive isolation has occurred between sister lineages.<br/><br/><br/>In the context of the above it has been pointed out for instance by Groves (2003) that dark-legged Chinese and Indochinese animals (‘<em>M. nigripes</em>’ of Groves and Grubb 2011) differ from paler, more uniform, animals to the south and west (‘<em>M. vaginalis</em>’ of Groves and Grubb 2011, for further details, see also C.P. Groves in litt. 1999 to Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1999). However, recent data (especially the results of camera-trapping studies) from Indochina suggest that pelage colour and pattern variation is little more than a geographically based polymorphism within a widespread species, and might not warrant even use in designation of subspecific taxa (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, based on unpublished data from various camera-trapping projects by WWF/WCS/FFI/SFNC/IUCN). There are certainly no grounds from field studies to suggest that more than one species-level taxon is present in Indochina (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). <br/><br/>Because objective morphological grounds to allow confident separation of the two species <em>M. muntjak</em> and <em>M. vaginalis</em> are not yet validated, because published sources and opinion in the region universally treat the two as conspecific, and because surveys have not systematically been examining the chromosomes of muntjacs, for the purposes of this red list assessment, each species' range and status have been assessed taking an assumption that the Isthmus of Kra forms the boundary between the two. This follows the assessment of Groves and Grubb (1990), based on rather few specimens, which segregated animals primarily on the basis of pelage and nasal characters, these authors noted the presence of specimens from two localities just south of the Isthmus of Kra which were somewhat atypical from presumed <em>M. muntjak</em> specimens further south. Many other vertebrates have diagnosable Sunda and northern members, but the range boundary between them can occur anywhere over a relatively wide latitudinal zone (e.g. Hughes <em>et al.</em> 2003), and outlier populations of one or the other taxon can occur within the range of its sister. Most taxa with clearly different Sundaic and mainland taxa are closely associated with ‘evergreen’ or semi-evergreen closed canopy forest, which makes the phylogeography of these species relatively easy to understand, however <em>M. muntjak s. l.</em> is generally unlike these in having a very broad habitat usage which includes deciduous open canopy forest formations, as such the exposed Sunda shelf at the height of the Pleistocene presumably provided a link between <em>M. muntjak s. l.</em> on the mainland in southern Indochina with those on northern Borneo. <em>M. vaginalis</em> as used here may thus occur in the Sundas. <br/><br/>During the 2008 review, a number of sources indicated that Red Muntjac was being identified by vocalisation, even in areas where congeners were known or likely to occur. There is no available information on vocal characters of other muntjacs, and how to distinguish different muntjacs by voice, or even whether this is possible. Therefore, such identifications were taken as only indicating the genus."

To date, new specimens and camera trapping photographs from Bolivia (Yensen <em>et al.</em> 1994, Rumiz <em>et al</em>. 2007) and new specimens and photographs from Peru, provide evidence that the southern Andean form is the same as the <em>M. chunyi</em> originally described by Hershkovitz (1959).

There is no question of the validity of <em>M. atherodes</em> as a species, because it has multiple diagnostic features and is widely sympatric with Southern Red Muntjac <em>M. muntjak</em> (Groves and Grubb 1982, 1990); but identification to species, particularly on field views and typical camera-trap photographs, of the two muntjacs on Borneo is difficult, and many observers have therefore considered it sensible to present survey results only as 'muntjac sp(p)'.

The species name is often mis-spelt <em>eldi</em>, but the correct original spelling, which must be used today, is <em>eldii</em>.<span lang=""EN-US""><br/><span lang=""EN-US""><br/> Phylogeography studies support the recognition of three subspecies (Balakrishnan <em>et al</em>. 2003), with their ranges as follows:&#160;<em>R. e. eldii</em>,&#160;India;&#160;<em>R. e. thamin</em>,&#160;Myanmar, westernmost Thailand (Bhumpakphan <em>et al</em>. no date);&#160;<em>R. e. siamensis</em>,&#160;Cambodia, China, Lao PDR, Thailand (excepting southwestern most; Bhumpakphan<em> </em><em>et al</em>. no date), Viet Nam.<span lang=""EN-US""><br/><span lang=""EN-US""><br/>Validation of, and the ultimate basis of identification of animals for, the various stated distributions of <em>R. e. thamin</em> and <em>R. e. siamensis</em> in Thailand are obscure and have not been researched for this account; such research however is warranted especially in view of the taxonomic status of these two subspecies and in relationship to reintroduction efforts in Thailand.<span lang=""EN-US""><br/><span lang=""EN-US""><br/> Although <em>R. e. eldii</em> (Sangai) is apparently very closely related to <em>R. e. thamin</em> based on genetic studies, it has significantly different ecology from other subspecies as well as apparently being the more divergent in morphology (Balakrishnan <em>et al. </em>2003). The Chinese subpopulation on Hainan island has at times been considered a separate subspecies <em>R. e. hainanus</em>, but there appears to be little to support this stance (Balakrishnan <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2003).</span></span></span>"
29742,Rangifer tarandus,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,CETARTIODACTYLA,MAMMALIA,CERVIDAE,Rangifer,tarandus,,,,,"(Linnaeus, 1758)","The world’s Caribou and Reindeer are classified as a single species <em>Rangifer</em> <em>tarandus</em>. Reindeer is the European name for the species while in North America, the species is known as Caribou. Here we use either name or <em>Rangifer</em>. <br/><br/>Identification of subspecies has changed over time (Banfield 1961, Geist 2007) and currently, Grubb (2005) lists 14 sub-species of which two are extinct: <em>eogroenlandicus </em>and <em>dawsoni</em>, however, the latter may have been an island dwarf form (Byun <em>et al.</em> 2002). In Russia, the use of subspecies differs from Grubb (2005) as <em>angustirostris </em>is recognized but not <em>buskensis </em>(I. Mizin pers. comm.). The subspecies are distinguished largely on skeletal and skull measurements, antler architecture and behaviour. The major groupings of subspecies are Boreal forest, continental tundra and high Arctic island. Based on current abundance, continental tundra caribou are the most numerous (56%) relative to mountain (19%), the forest (14%) and Arctic island (11%). <br/><br/>The current diversity of <em>Rangifer </em>resulted from local adaptations, which followed large-scale changes in distribution as continental glaciations advanced and retreated during the Pleistocene (Yannic <em>et al.</em> 2013). Analyses of mitochondrial and nucleotide DNA reveal that glaciations divided <em>Rangifer </em>into two lineages. The ice sheets were more extensive in North Ameri<em>ca.</em> Thus, the Euro-Beringia lineage was restricted to Alaska while the North American lineage was restricted to south of the ice sheets. The Euro-Beringia lineage is genetically the most varied and is widely distributed from Eurasia to northwestern America also including Greenland, Svalbard and the Canadian Arctic island archipelagos (Yannic <em>et al.</em> 2013). The second lineage, the North American lineage (essentially woodland caribou), has less genetic variation and a more restricted distribution limited to Newfoundland/Labrador and eastern Canada. After deglaciation about 10,000 years ago, changing distribution during recolonization, secondary contact between the two lineages occurred in central and western Canada (Weckworth <em>et al.</em> 2012, Yannic <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/>Genetic variability is typically high among the larger migratory herds of migratory tundra Caribou (Zittlau 2004) because the effective population size is large and geographic barriers are largely lacking. Elsewhere in the mountains, genetic variation reveals a complex history influenced by events including ancient volcanic eruptions, founder events, geography and changing abundance and distribution of neighbouring herds (Kuhn <em>et al.</em> 2010, Serrouya <em>et al.</em> 2012). On the arctic islands, genetic variation is reduced because those populations have been through severe reductions in abundance with consequent genetic bottlenecks and genetic drift (Zittlau 2004, Petersen <em>et al.</em> 2010).<br/><br/>Dispersal whether innate or environmental is largely unrecorded in <em>Rangifer </em>except at the scale of genetic migration. DNA analyses have revealed low rates of male-biased genetic flow between neighbouring and geographically dispersed <em>Rangifer </em>(Boulet <em>et al.</em> 2005, Roffler <em>et al.</em> 2012). <br/><br/>The subspecies designations are based on an outdated taxonomy and are inconsistent with current understanding of evolutionary relationships and ecology (Flagstad and Røed 2003, Zittlau 2005, Røed 2005). However, in the context of conservation and management, recognizable and credible ‘conservation units’ or ‘evolutionary significant units’ are essential. In Canada, for example, COSEWIC (2012) assessed all available information to create 12 designatable units to recognize variability in form, ecology and genetics previously combined in four sub-species. We will refer to recognizable conservation units throughout this assessment as these are the basis for estimating abundance. Then we have summed the subspecies or conservation units to assess <em>Rangifer</em> at the species level."

136831,Muntiacus montanus,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,CETARTIODACTYLA,MAMMALIA,CERVIDAE,Muntiacus,montanus,,,,,"Robinson &amp; Kloss, 1918","The muntjac taxon <em>montanus</em> has generally been considered to lie within <em>Muntiacus muntjak</em> (Robinson and Kloss 1918, Chasen 1940, Corbet and Hill 1992, Grubb 2005), although there are reasonable grounds to consider it specifically distinct from that taxon (Robinson and Kloss 1918, C. Groves pers. comm. 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). It was treated as a distinct species by Miller (1942) on the basis of a single specimen available to him that clearly was not conspecific with <em>Muntiacus muntjak muntjak</em>, which also inhabits Sumatra. He was not able to examine Robinson and Kloss’s specimens and so retained a margin of doubt that his skull was conspecific with the latter. There remain very few validated records of the taxon, which externally is not greatly different from <em>M. muntjak,</em> which together continues to cloud its treatment as a valid species.<br/><br/>As with muntjacs in Borneo (Groves and Grubb 1982), there has doubtless been some confusion and misidentification of Sumatran specimens in past literature. Reviewers including Miller (1942), Van Bemmel (1952), and Groves and Grubb (1990) certainly or apparently had no access to the specimens used to describe the taxon. This may well have led to erroneous views on the taxon’s diagnostic features. The holotype is in the Natural History Museum, London (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008), rather than lost, contrary to Van Bemmel (1952). The degree of misidentification of specimens, if any, can be determined only through thorough re-evaluation of Sumatran muntjac specimens, including those used by previous authors. Further confusion has arisen through suggestions that <em>M. montanus</em> is the Sumatran ‘equivalent’ of Bornean <em>M. atherodes</em>, the two having features in common (formerly mistakenly called <em>M. pleiharicus</em>, which name is now recognised to be the valid name for the race of <em>M. muntjak</em> on Borneo), although the two species show very little similarity in characters that are likely to be taxonomically informative (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). There has also been a pre-eminence awarded by authors such as Van Bemmel (1952) to use of general body pelage, body size and antler size for distinction between the two Sumatran muntjac species, characters which are unlikely to be diagnostic in any way (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). These appear to be the primary characters used by Van Bemmel (1952) when concluding that a specimen from “Tebing Tinggi, lowlands of Deli, East Sumatra … is more or less intermediate between [<em>M. m. muntjak</em> and <em>M. montanus</em>]…” and “proof that <em>M. m. montanus</em> cannot be regarded as a good species”. Van Bemmel (1952) mentions nothing of the large size of the preorbital fossa, identified by Miller (1942), or specific details about the crown pelage of females, both likely to be main diagnostic characteristics of the species (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, neither character were mentioned by Groves and Grubb 1990)."

The latter authors also placed this species and the closely related <em>C. alfredi</em> within the subgenus <em>Rusa</em>, whilst subsequent reviews of the systematic relationships and phylogeny of southeast Asian deer by Meijaard and Groves (2004) and Pitra <em>et al</em>.

However, the systematic (and distributional) relationships of the latter two forms  are not clearly understood at the present time, especially as deer from Mindanao tend to be highly variable in body size (e.g. these two subspecies embrace both the smallest and largest deer from the Philippines; W.

Several subspecies have been proposed based  on extensive variation in pelage colour and morphology across the  distribution. Within southern Africa, Roberts (1951) proposed 20  subspecies of which Meester <em>et al. </em>(1986) regarded only seven as being  valid. Rambau&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>(2003) recommended the recognition of two species  based on cytogenetic and mitochondrial sequence data, the xeric <em>R</em>.<em> pumilio</em> and mesic <em>R</em>. <em>dilectus</em>, which was adopted by Musser and Carleton (2005). The authors further suggested the presence of two subspecies, <em>R</em>. <em>d</em>. <em>dilectus</em> and <em>R</em>.<em> d</em>. <em>chakae</em> within the latter taxon. This was confirmed in a recent molecular and chromosomal analysis of <em>R</em>. <em>dilectus</em>,  which revealed high genetic divergence within the species, and the  presence of three distinct clades (Castiglia&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012). The basal  clade, recognised as <em>R</em>. <em>d</em>. <em>chakae</em> is endemic to South Africa, while the two distinct sister clades (<em>R</em>. <em>d</em>. <em>dilectus</em>)  are distributed allopatrically across northern parts of its range, into  East Africa, including a new divergent karyotype found in the high  altitudes of Mt. Meru and Mt. Kilimanjaro (Castiglia&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012).  Reproductive isolation due to pre- and post-mating barriers have been  found among <em>R</em>. <em>pumilio</em> and <em>R</em>.<em> dilectus</em>, as  well as among the proposed subspecies within the latter taxon (Pillay  2000, Pillay&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006). Subsequently, du Toit&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>(2012) indicated  three genetic lineages with distinct distributions related to biome  boundaries within the xeric <em>R</em>. <em>pumilio</em>. Based on deep mitochondrial genetic divergence, paraphyly of <em>R</em>. <em>pumilio </em>with respect to <em>R</em>. <em>dilectus</em> and different ecological preferences of the three genetic lineages within <em>R</em>. <em>pumilio</em>, the recognition of four species (<em>R</em>. <em>dilectus</em>,<em> R</em>. <em>pumilio</em>, <em>R</em>. <em>bechuanae</em>, and <em>R</em>. <em>intermedius</em>) was suggested (du Toit<em> et al. </em>2012). However, Monadjem&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>(2015) recognise <em>R</em>.<em> chakae</em> as a valid species due to at least one case of known sympatry between <em>R</em>. <em>d</em>. <em>dilectus</em> and <em>R</em>. <em>d</em>.<em> chakae</em>.  Further molecular research (particularly including more nuclear data)  and cranial morphometric analyses would be useful to fully resolve the  taxonomy of the genus. Until such time, it is recommended that <em>Rhabdomys</em> be treated as a species complex."

The latter species remains provisional, however, awaiting further study of taxonomic differentiation within the ‘scrofic’ group of pigs. What remains unclear is whether a verrucosic-type pig species existed in the Annamite Mountains area that hybridized with a 'scrofic' type species (<em>scrofa</em> or <em>moupinensis</em>) to the point that it is no longer morphologically distinct. Alternatively, there was never a distinct taxon. Pending further study, <em>Sus bucculentus </em>is classified as Extinct until better evidence regarding its taxonomy becomes available.<br/></p>"

Groves and Ryder (2000) proposed that the two be treated as distinct species, and Groves and Bell (2004) presented morphological evidence for separating the two subspecies as distinct species based on the diagnosability criterion of the phylogenetic species concept. Recent genetic analyses indicate that the two populations have a high incidence of mitochondrial haplotype sharing; the hypothesis that Cape and Hartmann's Mountain Zebra mitochondrial lineages were reciprocally monophyletic was not supported (Moodley and Hartley 2005). However, the presence of private alleles at nuclear loci rendered the two subspecies genetically distinct evolutionary significant units.

The six subspecies differ from one another in morphological characteristics, such as coat patterns and colouration, body size, and the presence (or absence) of a mane (Groves &amp; Bell 2004). Although there is limited evidence for genetic diversity between subspecies and the classification may be a contested topic (Bennett 1980), a classification of subspecies can be useful as a way to emphasise ecological and morphological differences for management purposes. Following Groves and Bell (2004), six morphologically defined subspecies are listed as:<br/><ul><li><em>Equus</em> <em>q</em>. <em>crawshaii </em>(Crawshay’s Zebra) occurs in east Zambia, east of Luangwa River, Malawi, south-eastern Tanzania, and Mozambique as far south as the Gorongoza district.</li><li><br/></li><li><em>Equus</em> <em>q</em>. <em>borensis </em>(Maneless Zebra) ranges over the northern parts of east Africa from north-west Kenya to the Karamoja district of Uganda and south-east Sudan, east of the Nile River (Boma National Park) to the northern limit of the species’ range (32 °N).</li><li><br/></li><li><em>Equus</em> <em>q</em>. <em>boehmi</em> (Grant’s Zebra or Boehm’s Zebra) is found in Zambia, west of the Luangwa River, west to Kariba, the Shaba Province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo north to Kibanzao Plateau, Tanzania north from Nyangaui abnd Kibwezi into south-west Uganda, south-west Kenya, and east Kenya, east of the Rift Valley, into southern Ethiopia and perhaps to the Juba River in Somalia.

Thus the extinct <em>E</em>. <em>q</em>. <em>quagga </em>should be considered a subspecies of <em>E</em>. <em>quagga</em>. From north to south of their geographic range, extant Plains Zebras show a gradual decline in the contrast between dark stripes and white interspaces, and an increase in body size is noted from east to south (Lorenzen et al. 2008). The extinct Cape Quagga, which was found at the southern limit of the species’ geographic range, exhibited the extreme case of this trend in pelage colouration (Groves &amp; Bell 2004; Lorenzen et al. 2008)."

Taxonomic review of the species is urgently needed; otherwise, it is possible that some forms may go extinct before they are formally identified.<br/> <br/> Hoffmann and Smith (2005) restricted <em>L. capensis</em> to the South African distribution, citing no evidence of gene flow between the southern and northern ranges. A list of synonyms is provided based on four geographic locations (South Africa, East Africa, Arabia and Near East, and northwest Africa), which are informal subdivisions of <em>L. capensis sensu lato</em>. The authors suggested that these four groups might represent distinct species. In the Near East and Arabia <em>L. c. arabicus</em>; in South Africa <em>L. c. capensis; L. c. aquilo, L. c. carpi, L. c. granti</em>; East Africa <em>L. c. aegyptius, L. c. hawkeri, L. c. isabellinus, L. c. sinaiticus; and L. c. atlanticus</em>, <em>L. c. schulmbergeri, L. c. whitakeri </em>in northwest Africa (Hoffmann and Smith 2005, Schai-Braun and Hackländer 2018).<br/> <br/> According to Harrison and Bates (1991) there are eight subspecies in Arabia:<em> L. c. syriacus</em> (Syria, Lebanon, northern Israel);<em> L. c. sinaiticus</em> (southern Israel, Sinai);<em> L. c. connori</em> (east of the Euphrates in Iraq); <em>L. c. arabicus </em>(western Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Yemen); <em>L. c. cheesmani</em> (Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE, Yemen, Oman);<em> L. c. omanensis </em>(UAE, Oman); <em>L. c. atallahi </em>(Bahrain, Qatar?); <em>L. c. jefferyi </em>(Masirah Island, Oman). The taxonomic status of <em>L. c. jefferyi </em>needs clarification, as it may represent a good species. Hares present in Qatar also require taxonomic investigation. <br/> <br/> The taxonomic position of the Sardinian Hare is unresolved. Hoffmann and Smith (2005) include the Sardinian Hare as one of the unassigned synonyms of <em>L. mediterraneus</em> Wagner, 1841 or <em>typicus </em>Hilzheimer, 1906, in <em>L. granatensis</em>. Analysis of the mtCR-1 sequence indicated that Sardinian Hares form a monophyletic clade with North African Hares (Scandura <em>et al. </em>2007). A genetic and morphometric analysis supports the hypothesis that the Sardinian Hare was introduced from North Africa (Canu<em> et al.</em> 2012). A phylogenetic analysis of mtCR-1 sequences from Tunisian and Egyptian Hares characterized them as monophyletic and separate from<em> L. capensis</em> (Ben Slimen <em>et al.</em> 2006). However, a study of the nuclear gene pool of<em> L. capensis, L. europaeus</em> and the North African Hare indicated that the North African Hare as well as <em>L. europaeus</em> belong to<em> L. capensis </em>(Ben Slimen <em>et al.</em> 2005), supporting Petter's (1959, 1961) hypothesis of the inclusion of<em> L. europaeus </em>in <em>capensis</em>. Ben Slimen<em> et al. </em>(2008a) suggest that in a case such as the genus <em>Lepus</em>, where evolution is ""rapid and to some extent reticulate"", species designation based solely on mtDNA is misleading without examination of the nuclear gene pool. Ben Slimen <em>et al.</em> (2008a) has shown that genetic differentiation between <em>L. capensis </em>and <em>L. europaeus</em> could be attributed to geographic distance rather than divergence. They speculate that gene flow may be occurring in the Near East where distributions meet resulting in the potential for intergraded populations. However, Ben Slimen<em> et al</em>. (2008b) propose that ""a combined phylogenetic, phylogeographic, and population genetic approach…, based on various nuclear and mitochondrial markers and including other biological characters, such as phenotypic and morphometric data,"" is needed for conclusive evidence of a single species complex. A recent study looking at a partial transferrin nuclear gene and phylogenetic relationship of hares in Tunisia showed “shared ancestral polymorphism between North African and Chinese hares” (Awadi <em>et al. </em>2016). It also concluded that the Tunisian Hare is “well differentiated from hares considered belonging to brown hares<em> L. europaeus</em> from central Europe” (Awadi<em> et al.</em> 2016). In light of this continuing uncertainty regarding the taxonomic status of the Sardinian and North African Hares, both will remain included in <em>capensis </em>and<em> L. europaeus</em> retains its taxonomic status as a distinct species.<br/> <br/> Many treatments indicate that the range of<em> L. capensis</em> extends into China, Mongolia and Russia; however, recognition of <em>L. tibetanus </em>and <em>L. tolai</em> as distinct species removes consideration of <em>L. capensis </em>as occurring in this region (Hoffmann and Smith 2005)."

Clear distinction to other taxa is difficult due to sympatric occurrences with other <em>Lepus</em> species. The European Hare was formerly included in the Cape Hare (<em>L. capensis</em>) based on a cline in morphological characters (mainly size) from north-eastern Africa eastwards across the northern Arabian peninsula, the Middle East and northwards through Israel to Turkey (Petter 1961). A reanalysis showed a discontinuity between smaller “<em>capensis</em>” and larger “<em>europaeus</em>” running from the eastern Mediterranean coast through Iran (Ben Slimen <em>et al.</em> 2008). A study of the nuclear gene pool of the Cape Hare, the European Hare and the North African Hare, indicated that the North African Hare as well as the European Hare belong to the Cape Hare (Ben Slimen <em>et al.</em> 2005). However, a study of the mt DNA of these three groups indicated a significant degree of divergence supporting species specific designation (Ben Slimen <em>et al.</em> 2008a, 2008b). These studies show that genetic differentiation between the Cape Hare and the European Hare might be attributed to geographic distance rather than divergence. Until conclusive evidence of a single species complex is available in order to support a change in the taxonomic status of the European Hare, it remains a true species (Hackländer and Schai-Braun 2018, Schai-Braun and Hackländer 2016).<br/> <br/> There are 16 subspecies: <em>Lepus europaeus caspicus, L. e. connori, L. e. creticus, L. e. cyprius, L. e. cyrensis, L. e. europaeus, L. e. hybridus, L. e. judeae, L. e. karpathorum, L. e. medius, L. e. occidentalis, L. e. parnassius, L. e. ponticus, L. e. rhodius, L. e. syriacus</em>, and <em>L. e. transsylvanicus</em> (Hoffmann and Smith 2005). It is felt that there is considerable variability in many of these forms and that distinctions between subspecies may be arbitrary as they are mostly based on size and colour. Molecular phylogenetic studies in Spain revealed that the Cantabric population has singular mt DNA compared to other European populations (Palacios <em>et al.</em> 2004).

The first major revision (Heptner 1934) united <em>L. europaeus</em>, <em>L. tolai</em>, and <em>L. tibetanus</em> in a single species, but Ognev (1966:154) rejected this concept, stating that ""...there is much evidence against considering the common hare, the Tolai and desert hares as one species..."". Next, Ellerman (in Ellerman and Morrison-Scott 1955) placed <em>L. tibetanus</em> as a subspecies of <em>L. capensis</em>, along with <em>L. tolai</em>, he was supported by Petter (1959, 1961). Then Harrison (1972) added L. arabicus to <em>L. capensis</em>. Some, however, continued to follow Ognev. Bannikov (1954), Sokolov and Orlov (1980), and Shou (1962) provided details of distribution in Mongolia and China respectively. Luo (1981) performed a cluster analysis which he interpreted as supporting Ellerman <em>et al.</em>, but was strongly criticized by Zhao, Zheng and Zhou (1983) for his methodology. Qui (1989) then re-analyzed the data, and found that three races of <em>L. tibetanus</em> were clearly separated from four races of L. tolai (although Qui continued to employ L. capensis as the species name). <em>L. tibetanus</em> shares certain characteristics with <em>L. oiostolus</em> (but not <em>L. capensis</em> or <em>L. tolai</em>) of the adjacent Tibetan Plateau, most notably the relatively long premaxillary and short nasal bones, combined with greater procumbency of the incisors, as well as other cranial and pelage characters described by Ognev (1966). Evaluation of these characters across the zones of potential contact between the ten taxon pairs comprising <em>L. capensis</em> sensu lato, is necessary before the taxonomy of these hares can be resolved (Hoffmann 1998). Hoffmann and Smith (2005) recognized five subspecies: <em>Lepus tibetanus centrasiaticus</em>, <em>L. t. craspedotis</em>, <em>L. t. pamirensis</em>, <em>L. t. stoliczkanus</em>, and <em>L. t. tibetanus</em>. More recently, a molecular analysis assigned centrasiaticus to <em>L. tolai</em> (Cheng <em>et al.</em> 2012). Smith <em>et al.</em> (2018) consider the Desert Hare to be monotypic."

Similarly, Arnason <em>et al.</em> (2006), using whole mitochondrial genome sequences also concluded the Caspian Seal to be most closely related to the Grey Seal, with the Baikal Seal forming a sister taxon, with <em>Phoca </em>and Ringed Seals outside this group. Fulton and Strobeck (2010) using nearly 9,000 base pairs of nuclear gene sequences and complete mtDNA genomes, placed Halichoreus basal to the group, with <em>Pusa </em>and <em>Phoca </em>as sister clades, and <em>Pusa caspica</em> basal to the <em>Pusa</em> genus. The most recent assessment (Nyakatura and Bininda-Emonds 2012), a super tree analysis of all carnivora combining 114 trees from the literature and 45,000 base pairs of DNA sequence, supports the grouping of <em>Halichoreus </em>within <em>Pusa</em>, with <em>Phoca </em>as a sister clade. <em>Pusa caspica</em> and <em>Halichoreus grypus</em> are indicated as sister species, diverging about 1.6 million years ago.

The very limited genetic differences between these taxa (Fulton and Strobeck 2010) argue for inclusion of all of them in a single genus, <em>Phoca</em>, (Nyakatura and Bininda-Emonds 2012) but widespread reluctance to rename the Grey Seal has led to common, though not universal, use of <em>Pusa </em>as a full genus despite the typical placement of <em>Halichoerus</em> in its midst on recent molecular phylogenetic trees (e.g., Committee on Taxonomy 2014). In contrast to the nomenclature for the genus, use of the species name <em>hispida </em>for the Ringed Seals inhabiting the Arctic Ocean and adjoining seas has been broadly accepted&#160;(Rice 1998).<br/><br/>There are currently five recognized subspecies of Ringed Seal (Rice 1998, Committee on Taxonomy 2014), the Arctic Ringed Seal (<em>P. h. hispida</em>), the Okhotsk Ringed Seal (<em>P. h. ochotensis</em>), the Baltic Ringed Seal (<em>P. h. botnica</em>), the Ladoga Seal (<em>P. h. ladogensis</em>), and the Saimaa Seal (<em>P. h. saimensis</em>). Each of the subspecies has been individually assessed by the IUCN Pinniped Specialist Group. This assessments combines those results to determine the status of Ringed Seals at the species level."
41676,Pusa sibirica,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,CARNIVORA,MAMMALIA,PHOCIDAE,Pusa,sibirica,,,,,"(Gmelin, 1788)","The Baikal Seal belongs to the Phocina group of northern seals, which includes the Ringed Seals (<em>Pusa</em>), the Harbour and Spotted Seals (<em>Phoca</em>), and the Grey Seal (<em>Halichoerus</em>). The radiation of the Phocina group is believed to have started in the northern seas of the late Pliocene, 2-3 million years ago, and was accompanied by invasion of the continental basins, though the paleogeography in this period is still not clear (Palo and Väinöla 2006, Fulton and Strobeck 2010).<br/><br/>The taxonomic relationships between the seals of the continental lakes and open ocean has long been debated, and the placement of the Baikal and Caspian Seals has varied between the genera <em>Pusa </em>and <em>Phoca.</em> Cladistic and phylogenetic studies from the 1970s to present, based on morphology, and more recently mitochondrial and nuclear gene DNA sequences datasets, considered <em>Phoca</em>, <em>Pusa</em>, <em>Histriophoca</em>, and <em>Pagophilus </em>to be a monophyletic group (Wozencraft 2005). These analyses support two clades, <em>Pagophilus </em>and <em>Histriophoca </em>and the Phocina group, <em>Phoca</em>, <em>Pusa</em>, and <em>Halichoerus </em>(Rice 1998, Bininda-Emonds <em>et al.</em> 2007, Arnason <em>et al.</em> 2006, Fulton and Strobeck 2010, Nyakatura and Bininda-Emonds 2012).<br/><br/>Using a multigene mitochondrial dataset, Palo and Väinöla (2006) considered <em>Pusa </em>not to be a monophyletic group, with the Phocina forming a polytomy. Arnason <em>et al.</em> (2006), using whole mitochondrial genome sequences concluded the Caspian Seal to be most closely related to the Grey Seal, with the Baikal Seal forming a sister taxon, with <em>Phoca </em>and Ringed Seals outside this group. Fulton and Strobeck (2010) using nearly 9,000 base pairs of nuclear gene sequences and complete mtDNA genomes, placed <em>Halichoreus </em>basal to the group, with <em>Pusa </em>and <em>Phoca </em>as sister clades. <em>Pusa caspica </em>was suggested as basal to the <em>Pusa </em>genus, with Baikal and Ringed Seals as sister taxa. The most recent assessment (Nyakatura and Bininda-Emonds 2012), a super tree analysis of all carnivora combining 114 trees from the literature and 45,000 base pairs of DNA sequence, supports the grouping of <em>Halichoreus </em>within <em>Pusa</em>, with <em>Phoca </em>as a sister clade. The Baikal Seal is indicated as basal to the grouping of <em>Pusa caspica </em>and <em>Halichoreus grypus</em>, with a divergence time of around 1.6-2 million years ago. Nyakatura and Bininda-Emonds (2012) advocate subsuming <em>Halichoreus </em>and <em>Pusa </em>within the <em>Phoca </em>genus."

However, domestic oxen with Kouprey-like features, if they exist today, must be localized in occurrence, as 'Zebu' types predominate in most areas (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Partial analysis of mitochondrial DNA has been used to suggest Kouprey could have arisen relatively recently as a result of hybridisation (Galbreath <em>et al</em>. 2006), however, there are many reasons to consider such a scenario the least likely of several more plausible alternatives for the origin of Kouprey (Hedges <em>et al</em>. 2007), and there is little doubt that Kouprey is a valid species (Vidthayanon and Bhumpakphan 2004, Galbreath <em>et al</em>. 2007, Grigson 2007, Hassanin and Ropiquet 2007, Hedges <em>et al</em>. 2007)."

Therefore, IUCN considers the wild species of Gaur under <em>Bos gaurus</em>, while referring to the domestic form (Mythun, Mithan or Gayal) as <em>Bos frontalis</em> Lambert, 1804 (see Gentry <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/> <br/>Traditionally, three subspecies of Gaur have been recognized: <em>Bos gaurus gaurus</em> in India, Nepal, and Bhutan; <em>B. g. readei</em> in Myanmar (Burma), southern China, Lao PDR, Viet Nam, Cambodia, and Thailand north of the Isthmus of Kra (Lydekker 1903); and <em>B. g. hubbacki</em> in Thailand south of the Isthmus of Kra and in West Malaysia (Lydekker 1907). (In addition, Hubback (1937) thought that there may be two subspecies of Gaur in Malaysia, one with a well developed dewlap and one without.) However, this trifid arrangement, based largely on differences in colouration and size, is no longer widely recognized (Grzimek 1990, Corbet and Hill 1992).<br/> <br/>Groves and Grubb (cited in National Research Council 1983) concluded that there were only two subspecies: <em>Bos gaurus gaurus</em> in India and Nepal; and <em>Bos gaurus laosiensis</em> in Myanmar (Burma), Lao PDR, Viet Nam, Cambodia, Thailand, and West Malaysia (and presumably southern China). More recent work by Groves and colleagues (e.g., Groves 2003) also supports this division into two subspecies. Analysis of skull and horn measurements revealed little multivariate overlap between Indian and Southeast Asian specimens: Southeast Asian specimens are much bigger, with relatively shorter nasal bones, a less wide horn span and a narrower occiput; and in South-east Asian specimens the ascending branch of the premaxilla generally does not reach the nasal, whereas in Indian specimens it usually does. Specimens from Bhutan, Chittagong (Bangladesh), Upper Chindwin (north Myanmar), and Mogok (north Myanmar) were intermediate, but tended more towards the South-east Asian type. The locations of these specimens suggest that the Gaur in north-east India are also likely to be intermediate but more similar to southeast Asian animals than to the Gaur in the rest of India (C. Groves pers. comm. 1995). In recognition of these phenotypic differences, <em>B. g. gaurus</em> and <em>B. g. laosiensis</em> are provisionally accepted here pending further morphometric and genetic study.<br/> <br/>The extinct subspecies <em>B. g. sinhaleyus</em> survived on Sri Lanka into historic times (Grubb 2005)."

Levels of genetic diversity in <em>C</em>.<em> gnou </em>are lower compared to the Blue Wildebeest (<em>C</em>. <em>taurinus</em>) (Grobler et al. 2005 and ongoing work at the University of the Free State and the National Zoological Gardens), which is most likely due to the historic bottlenecks experienced by<em> C</em>.<em> gnou</em> in the late 1800s. The evolution of a distinct southern endemic Black Wildebeest in the Pleistocene was associated with, and possibly driven by, a shift towards a more specialised kind of territorial breeding behaviour, which can only function in open habitat. Thus, the evolution of the Black Wildebeest was directly associated with the emergence of Highveld-type open grasslands in the central interior of South Africa (Ackermann et al. 2010)."

Two subspecies are recognised: <em>Saiga tatarica tatarica</em> (to which the majority of the global population belongs), and <em>Saiga tatarica mongolica</em>, endemic to western Mongolia. <br/><br/>Mongolian Saiga was first described as a separate species, <em>Saiga mongolica</em> by Bannikov (1946) based on differences in skull measurements, shape and size of horns, and colour of pelage. However, the author later revised his opinion and considered it to be only a subspecies (Bannikov 1954).<br/><br/>Grubb (2005) recognized the Pleistocene mammoth-steppe Saiga as a distinct species <em>S. borealis</em>, following Baryshnikov and Tikhonov (1994) and included the living subspecies <em>mongolica</em>. However, a later analysis of mtDNA from 93 tissue samples from all five extant Saiga populations confirmed that<em> S. tatarica mongolica</em> is genetically distinct, whereas the four populations of the nominate subspecies are polyphyletic, consistent with recent fragmentation and population declines; there were slight but clear differences between <em>S. t. mongolica</em> and <em>S. t. tatarica</em>, confirming the current designation of <em>S. t. mongolica</em> as a subspecies rather than a species Kholodova <em>et al.</em> (2006). <br/><br/>A second genetic study (Campos<em> et al.</em> 2010) analysed modern and fossil Saiga using mtDNA from 27 ancient and 38 modern specimens from all parts of Saiga range, including two specimens of putative <em>S. borealis</em>. The results showed two distinct lineages, the first including all modern and fossil Saiga from north-east Yakutia and the Urals; the second occurring only in the northern Urals and is now extinct. Campos <em>et al.</em> (2010) conclude that: “...the data suggest that <em>S. borealis </em>does not constitute a distinct subspecies or species”. Furthermore, the authors of this 2010 study include both Baryshnikov and Tikhonov, co-authors of the 1994 paper, and who are therefore regarded as supporting this revised view (Mallon 2016a).<br/><br/>The two genetic studies carried out to date show slight genetic differences between the two forms and agree that mongolica should be considered a subspecies. However, these conclusions are based on mtDNA only and depend on a relatively small number of Mongolian samples. For a definitive view of the phylogenetic relationship between tatarica and mongolica, further analysis based on a larger sample size and including nuclear DNA is needed."

Recent evidence supports the separation of two distinct groups, corresponding to a West and Central African group and an East and Southern African group (Smitz <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013). The East and Southern African group is comprised of a single subspecies (<em>Syncerus caffer caffer</em>), which is found in the assessment region. The West and Central African group is assigned to two or three subspecies (<em>S</em>. <em>c</em>. <em>nanus</em>, <em>S</em>. <em>c</em>. <em>brachyceros </em>and <em>S</em>. <em>c</em>.<em> aequinoctialis</em>), although the latter two of these subspecies are not recognised by all authorities (Le Roex <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012, Smitz <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013).<br/><br/>The West African Savannah Buffalo, <em>S</em>. <em>c</em>. <em>brachyceros</em> (from Senegal to Cameroon) and the Central African Savannah Buffalo, <em>S</em>. <em>c</em>. <em>aequinoctialis </em>(from Central Africa to Sudan) are morphologically intermediate between <em>S</em>. <em>c</em>. <em>caffer</em> (Southern Savannah Buffalo) and <em>S</em>. <em>c</em>. <em>nanus</em> (Forest Buffalo) (Skinner and Chimimba 2005). Forest Buffalo are adapted to forest life, having a smaller size, unobtrusive swept back horns and a red to reddish-brown colouration, and are restricted to West Africa (Skinner and Chimimba 2005). Southern Savannah Buffalo are about twice the size of Forest Buffalo, with large downward curved horns and a brownish to black colouration (Smitz <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013). The taxonomic uncertainty in these four subspecies is corroborated by the observation of interbreeding and intermediate phenotypes in contact zones between all four subspecies (Prins 1996), and at least one reported cross between <em>S</em>. <em>c</em>.<em> caffer</em> and <em>S</em>. <em>c</em>. <em>nanus</em> (Smitz <em><em>et al.</em> </em>2013).

Evidence suggests that buffalo populations in Uganda and the Central African Republic display the highest genetic diversity of all African Buffalo populations and this could be the region where the most overlap exists between the two main groups (<em>S</em>. <em>c</em>. <em>nanus</em> and <em>S</em>. <em>c</em>. <em>caffer</em>) (Smitz <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013). Analysis of 766 mtDNA sequences from 43 localities indicates that <em>S</em>. <em>c</em>. <em>caffer</em> is found in Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Botswana, South Africa and Namibia (Smitz <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013)."

Animals in the North Pacific are similar in size and morphology to North Atlantic Blue Whales and are also regarded as<em> B. m. musculus</em>, pending a genetic comparison of these populations. The Antarctic form <em>B. m. intermedia</em> is distinguished by its large body size and Antarctic distribution in summer. The Pygmy Blue Whale <em>B. m. brevicauda</em> has a number of morphological characteristics that distinguish it from <em>B. m. intermedia</em> and <em>B. m. musculus</em>. It occurs in the Indian Ocean, excluding the Antarctic, from Africa and Madagascar across to Indonesia and Australia, and in the southwestern Pacific, including Tasmania and New Zealand. Blue Whales in the northern Indian Ocean have been tentatively assigned the name<em> B. m. indica</em>, but a clear distinction between <em>B. m. indica </em>and <em>B. m. brevicauda</em> has not yet been established.<br/><br/>Blue Whales in the southeastern Pacific are intermediate in size between <em>B. m. intermedia</em> and<em> B. m. brevicauda</em> (Branch <em>et al</em>. 2007a) and are genetically differentiated from both groups (LeDuc<em> et al.</em> 2017). They are provisionally designated as an unnamed subspecies with the common name Chilean Blue Whales. Chilean Blue Whales are genetically most similar to Blue Whales in the northeast Pacific (LeDuc <em>et al.</em> 2017); investigations into the genetic and morphological distinction between these two groups are ongoing. The respective winter ranges of Blue Whales from the eastern South Pacific (Chilean Blue whales) and from the eastern North Pacific may overlap in the eastern equatorial Pacific but their breeding seasons are probably six months out of phase (LeDuc<em> et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/><u>UAE Taxonomic Note</u><br/>Several subspecies have been reported.

Most of the scientific literature prior to the late 1990s uses the name <em>B. acutorostrata</em> for all Minke Whales including Antarctic Minke Whales. Since 2000, the International Whaling Commission (IWC) Scientific Committee has recognized Antarctic Minke Whales as the separate species <em>B. bonaerensis</em>, and provisionally assigns all Northern Hemisphere Minke Whales and all Southern Hemisphere ""Dwarf"" Minke Whales to <em>B. acutorostrata</em> (IWC 2001). This practice has been followed by management and treaty bodies, such as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). <br/> <br/> The Dwarf Minke Whale is the common name used for&#160;<em>B. acutorostrata</em> in the Southern Hemisphere. It was initially described by Best (1985) and Arnold <em>et al</em>. (1987) in terms of its differences from the Antarctic Minke Whale. Subsequent genetic analyses (Wada <em>et al</em>. 1991, Pastene <em>et al</em>. 1994) revealed that the Dwarf Minke Whale is conspecific with the ""ordinary"" Minke Whale of the Northern Hemisphere, which was given the name Common Minke Whale, while the Antarctic Minke Whale is the separate species <em>B. bonaerensis</em> (see separate Red List assessment).<br/> <br/> Following Rice (1998) the Committee on Taxonomy of the Society for Marine Mammalogy provisionally recognizes three subspecies: <em>B. a. acutorostrata</em> (Lacépède, 1804) in the North Atlantic, <em>B. a. scammoni</em> (Deméré, 1986) (= <em>B. a . davidsoni</em>) in the North Pacific, and the Dwarf Minke Whale as an unnamed subspecies in the Southern Hemisphere (Committee on Taxonomy 2017). However, the limited sampling of Dwarf Minke Whales to date does not support the grouping together of all Southern Hemisphere Dwarf Minke Whales. For example, Pastene <em>et al</em>.

Most Bryde’s Whales analysed to date have been assignable to one of two sister clades: <em>Balaenoptera edeni brydei</em> is the larger, predominantly offshore form described by Olsen (1913) from animals taken by whalers operating out of Saldanha Bay and Durban, South Africa, while <em>B. e. edeni </em>is the smaller, predominantly coastal form described by Anderson (1879) from a specimen collected near the Sittang River, Gulf of Martaban, Myanmar, which is now held in the Indian Museum in Kolkata (Calcutta) (Sasaki <em>et al. </em>2006, Kershaw <em>et al.</em> 2013). A few authors have considered these as separate species following Wada <em>et al.</em> (2003). However, a single species,<em> B. edeni</em>, is recognized by the Committee on Taxonomy of the Society of Marine Mammalogy (Committee on Taxonomy 2017) and the International Whaling Commission (IWC). The Committee on Taxonomy recognizes<em> B. e. edeni </em>and <em>B. e. brydei</em> as subspecies.<br/><br/>The small population of Bryde’s Whales in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico appears to be only marginally closer to <em>B. e. edeni </em>than to<em> B. e. brydei </em>or <em>B. borealis </em>(Rosel and Wilcox 2014). This taxon has been assessed separately for the IUCN Red List as a subpopulation of <em>B. edeni</em>.<br/><br/>Best (1977) described a resident inshore form of Bryde's Whale off South Africa which is slightly smaller than the ""ordinary"" form of Bryde’s Whale found further offshore and speculated that it might be <em>B. e. edeni</em>. It differed in terms of migration, seasonality of reproduction, fecundity, and prey types (Best 2001). Best noted that Olsen's 1913 description of <em>B. brydei</em> was probably based on a mixture of this inshore form and ""ordinary"" Bryde's Whales caught off South Africa. Subsequent phylogenetic analysis has shown the inshore form to be closer to <em>B. e. brydei </em>than to<em> B. e. edeni</em> (Penry 2010).<br/><br/>To distinguish <em>B. e. brydei</em> from<em> B. e. edeni</em>, the former is variously called the “offshore”, “large-type”, or “ordinary” Bryde’s Whale. In the event that <em>B. brydei </em>and <em>B. edeni </em>become recognized as separate species, the common name ""Bryde's Whale"" will likely be retained for<em> B. e. brydei</em> and the name Eden’s Whale should be used for <em>B. e. edeni </em>as a subspecies or species. The name “Pygmy Bryde’s Whale” has been used for <em>B. e. edeni</em>, but in the past has also been applied to specimens of <em>B. omurai</em> (Wada <em>et al</em>. 2003), which is now known to be a separate species outside the Sei (<em>B. borealis</em>)/Bryde’s Whale clade (Sasaki<em> et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>Until 1972, Bryde’s Whale was recorded as Sei Whale in the International Whaling Statistics, although it had been separately recorded in Japanese whaling records as “Southern Sei Whale” since 1955 (Ohsumi 1977).<br/><u><br/>UAE Taxonomic Notes<br/></u>It has been proposed to split <em>Balaenoptera edeni</em> into two species (<em>B. brydei, B. edeni</em>). In the Arabian Seas evidence from phylogenetic analyses, and corroborating morphological and behavioural studies, supports the presence of both taxonomic units of Bryde’s whale, including a potentially discrete population <em>B. e. brydei</em>, and an apparently more commonly occurring and widely distributed population of <em>B. e. edeni</em> in coastal areas which exhibits unusually low levels of genetic diversity (Kershaw <em>et al.</em> 2013).&#160;However, a single species, <em>B. edeni</em>, is currently recognized by the Committee on Taxonomy of the Society of Marine Mammalogy (Committee on Taxonomy 2017) and the International Whaling Commission (IWC). The Committee on Taxonomy recognizes <em>B. e. edeni</em> and <em>B. e. brydei </em>as subspecies. <em>B. e. brydei</em> is the larger, predominantly offshore form, while <em>B. e. edeni </em>is the smaller, predominantly coastal form (Cooke and Brownell Jr 2018). The length of specimens recorded in the UAE ranges from approximately 10 m to at least 14 m, suggesting that two forms may be present, possibly representing different subspecies (Baldwin 2005)."

Since 2000, the International Whaling Commission (IWC) Scientific Committee has recognized Antarctic Minke Whales as the separate species <em>B. bonaerensis</em>, while all Northern Hemisphere Minke Whales and all Southern Hemisphere ""dwarf"" Minke Whales are regarded as <em>B. acutorostrata</em> (IWC 2001). This has been followed by management and treaty bodies, such as Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). This is based on genetic and morphological evidence that the two Minke Whale species, which are partially sympatric in the Southern Hemisphere, are distinct species (Rice 1998, Wada <em>et al</em>. 1991, Pastene <em>et al.</em> 1994, Pastene <em>et al</em>. 2007).<strong> </strong>"

Mitochondrial DNA suggested fine-scale division, with six populations identified, whilst microsatellite markers indicated two widespread populations. These results are in contrast to earlier genetic work that found no evidence of population structure between South Africa and Namibia (van Vuuren <em>et al</em>. 2002), due to poor sampling.

This putative species also occurs in rivers in Cochabamba, Santa Cruz, Beni, and Pando Departments of the Bolivian Amazon basin and in the Madeira River of Brazil. It does not overlap with other <em>Inia</em> populations in several morphological characters including rostral length, and it has significant differences in the number of teeth (da Silva 1994). The <em>boliviensis</em> form is considered to have been reproductively isolated by a long series of rapids for an estimated 3.1 million years (Hollatz <em>et al</em>. 2011). Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear introns have been interpreted as suggesting that these dolphins are on a separate evolutionary trajectory and therefore may deserve recognition as a phylogenetic species (Banguera-Hinestroza <em>et al.</em> 2002, Ruiz-García <em>et al.</em> 2008). However, Gravena <em>et al.</em> (2014a,b), with better sampling of the Madeira River system above and below the Teotônio Rapids (the proposed barrier to movement of individuals and gene flow), found that these rapids did not appear to obstruct gene flow from the upstream to the downstream population. Gravena <em>et al.</em> (2015) nevertheless concluded that <em>Inia</em> along the Madeira River possess the unique mtDNA of the putative species <em>I. boliviensis</em> (one line of evidence for recognizing species-level difference), and they argued that even if there is hybridization in the contact zone in the Madeira River, <em>Inia</em> below Teotônio remain distinct and follow an independent evolutionary path. </p><p>    </p><p>The nominal species <em>Inia araguaiaensis</em> was described from the Araguaia-Tocantins River basin (Hrbek <em>et al</em>. 2014), which is not connected to the Amazon River basin.

These dolphins are also known from the Guamá River. The Committee on Taxonomy (2017) reasoned that because Hrbek <em>et al.</em> (2014) only examined samples from two extremes of the distribution of&#160;<em>Inia</em> it was unclear if the molecular differences observed represented real species-level separation. In addition, the Committee concluded that diagnostic osteological differences were based on the examination of very few specimens (only two for the nominal species and nine for&#160;<em>I. geoffrensis)&#160;</em>and did not account for effects of the significant sexual dimorphism. A few more specimens were examined by Siciliano <em>et al.</em> (2016b) confirming the findings of Hrbek <em>et al</em>.

However, this assertion of species status rests on very little evidence, primarily the assumption that all <em>M. muntjac</em> in the Sunda region carry a unique karyotype different from all <em>M. vaginalis</em> in northern regions. However, the Sundaic karyotype has only been documented in a single individual from the Malay Peninsula south of the Ismuth of Kra. Other purported differences (e.g. dorsal darkening, Groves (2003)), if they can be considered characters rather than traits, appear minor and certainly not ones which would separate species level taxa. A much wider sampling of karyotype is needed for this systematic position to be placed on solid ground. <br/> <br/>Groves and Grubb 1990 considered the Sundaic <em>M. muntjak</em> populations to represent a single subspecies, while considering northern mainland populations (here considered as <em>M. vaginalis</em>) to be composed of many. However, many subspecies have been described from the Sunda region, and the geographical variation present is certainly equivalent to that present in (in <em>M. vaginalis</em>) northern regions. Javan and Malay Peninsula populations represent large red forms, Bornean and probably also Sumatran animals appear somewhat smaller and darker, while some offshore island populations (i.e. Bali) are probably significantly smaller. <br/> <br/>In this account, <em>Muntiacus muntjak</em> is considered to be exclusively restricted to peninsular Thailand south of the Isthmus of Kra, Peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra, Borneo, Java, Bali, Lombok and other small islands of the region (Kitchener <em>et al</em>. 1990, Groves 2003). The possible existence of hybrid populations (<em>M. vaginalis</em> x <em>M. muntjak</em>), in northern continental Malaysia, has also been recently pointed out by Groves (2005). <br/> <br/>Adding to the systematic confusion throughout the genus, the Red Muntjac is sometimes classified as <em>M. vaginalis</em>, including up to five subspecies including <em>nigripes</em> (Wang 2002)."

Rice (1998) concluded that <em>O. flavescens</em> has priority. More recently, Berta and Churchill (2012) noted that the specific name for this taxa is controversial, but concluded that <em>O. byronia</em> is “the earliest available name applicable with certainty.” <em>O. byronia</em> is the name approved by the Society for Marine Mammalogy (Committee on Taxonomy 2014) and will be used in the document. However, <em>O. flavescens</em> is still in use, particularly by South American scientists.<br/><br/>Szapkievich <em>et al.</em> (1999) conducted the first genetic study on the species, analyzing 10 protein loci in 70 South American Sea Lion pups from two rookeries 1,300 km apart (Isla de Lobos, Uruguay and Peninsula Valdés, Argentina). They found only a small genetic distance between the rookeries, suggesting that they belong to the same population in which gene flow is currently occurring. Túnez <em>et al.</em> (2007) studied the population structure of South American Sea Lions by analyzing mtDNA from a few colonies along the Atlantic coast, and comparing their results with five sequences previously published from Peruvian populations (Wynen <em>et al.</em> 2001). They found no haplotypes shared between the Atlantic and Peruvian colonies. The South Atlantic population from Uruguay to southern Patagonia was studied by means of mtDNA (Túnez <em>et al.</em> 2007, 2010; Feijoó <em>et al.</em> 2011) and microsatellites (Feijoó <em>et al.</em> 2011). While mitochondrial markers showed geographically structured sub-populations, the nuclear loci showed a lack of geographical structure. These opposite patterns in genetic structure can be explained by female phylopatry and high male dispersion (Feijoo <em>et al.</em> 2011). On the Chilean coast, Weinberger (2013) using eight microsatellite loci showed the existence of two genetic clusters separated at approximately 41° S, supporting the existence of two sub-populations or management units.<br/><br/>Gehara (2009) and Túnez <em>et al.</em> (2007) concluded there is significant genetic differentiation between South American Sea Lions in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, suggesting complete and prolonged isolation and distinct evolutionarily significant units (ESUs). This was based on 10 microsatellite loci and mtDNA sequences from 4 areas (Uruguay, Argentina, Chile, and Peru). However, the rookeries of southern South America need to be sampled and analyzed in order to establish the limit of gene flow between the two ocean basins (Oliveira pers. comm.)."

41780,Tragulus javanicus,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,CETARTIODACTYLA,MAMMALIA,TRAGULIDAE,Tragulus,javanicus,,,,,"(Osbeck, 1765)","Grubb (2005) stated that “Meijaard and Groves (2004) were not convinced that the original description of <i>Cervus javanicus</i> Osbeck, 1765 is a mouse-deer and preferred to date the name from <I>Tragulus javanicus</i> (Gmelin, 1788) [=<I>Moschus javanicus</I> Gmelin, 1788]”. However, Meijaard and Groves (2004) actually dated <I>Cervus javanicus</i> Osbeck to 1757, not to 1765. The situation is complicated and Meijaard and Groves (2004) indicated that they would be making a submission to the International Commission for Zoological Nomenclature. Pending the result of this, the name for this species follows usage by Grubb (2005).
<br>
<br>Whoever the name is credited to, the lack of any biological type material has led to its application within the genus <i>Tragulus</i> having a contorted history, elaborated in Meijaard and Groves (2004). In sum, usage in past publications of <i>T. javanicus</i> can rarely if ever be taken at face value to represent the species as circumscribed here, unless explicit mention is made that the statements refer to the animals of Java. Up to and including Chasen (1940), the name <i>T. javanicus</i> was used for the larger chevrotains, with <i>Moschus kanchil</i> Raffles, 1821 for the smaller ones (dated as 1822 by Meijaard and Groves 2004). Van Bemmel (1949), building on Chasen’s (1940: 194) comment that “I rather doubt if <i>javanicus</i> [i.e. the larger chevrotains] occurs there [ = anywhere on Java]”, proposed that <i>T. javanicus</i> should be used for the smaller chevrotains, with <i>Moschus napu</i> F. Cuvier, 1822 being the first available name for a larger chevrotain. This system almost universally was followed up to Meijaard and Groves (2004) who proposed that the smaller chevrotains contained several species, and that the form on Java was specifically distinct and endemic to the island. This form being <i>T. javanicus</i>, nearly all the off-Java forms fell under <i>T. kanchil</i>, as they previously had done under Chasen (1940). <i>Tragulus kanchil williamsoni</i> Kloss, 1916, placed within <i>T. javanicus</i> from Van Bemmel (1949) onwards, was segregated as a monotypic species by Meijaard and Groves (2004). 
<br>
<br>Further change within the taxonomy and nomenclature of the genus is likely, given the ominous statement in Meijaard and Groves (2004) that ""because many type specimens, especially of small island taxa are located in the Smithsonian Museum, which we did not visit, we were unable to assess the validity of all taxa. We intend to address the variation between these island taxa...in future publications"". Whatever the findings of these examinations, they are unlikely to affect usage of the name <i>T. javanicus</i> for a chevrotain on Java. A separate issue is whether there is truly only one species on the island. Meijaard and Groves (2004) reviewed past claims of two subspecies of smaller chevrotain and concluded that ""our craniometrical data indicate that there may indeed be two distinct mouse-deer taxa on Java. The data are, however, inconclusive...further research...is required"". These two taxa would both belong in the smaller chevrotains (the <i>T. javanicus</i> group). A yet further unresolved issue concerning the genus on Java is that three chevrotain specimens objectively and clearly identifiable as large chevrotains (<i>T. napu</i> group) were reported by the collector, E. Dubois, to be from Java; two have the precise and traceable locality of Mount Willis (Meijaard and Groves 2004). The latter suggested that ""it may be that Dubois collected these specimens during his earlier fieldwork in Sumatra, after which they were mislabelled"", a speculation for which there seems to be no foundation other than the lack of other specimens of <i>T. napu</i> from Java.
<br>
<br>In this preliminary assessment, the provisional course of assuming that all records of chevrotains from Java relate to <i>T. javanicus</i> is taken with reservations. Field identification of <i>Tragulus</i> is difficult, even under the pre-2004 conventional arrangement of two species widely sympatric. If there is only one species on Java, all records of the genus can safely be assumed to relate to that species; but if there are two or even three, assignment to <i>T. javanicus</i> without critical evaluation is not possible."

Van Bemmel (1949), building on Chasen’s (1940: 194) comment that “I rather doubt if <em>javanicus</em> [i.e. the larger chevrotain] occurs there [ = anywhere on Java]”, proposed that <em>T. javanicus</em> must therefore refer to smaller chevrotains, and, as an older name, should displace the use of <em>T. kanchil</em> for these animals. This system almost universally was followed up to Meijaard and Groves (2004) who proposed that the smaller chevrotains contained several species, and that the form on Java was specifically distinct and endemic to the island. This form being <em>T. javanicus</em>, nearly all the off-Java forms fell once again under <em>T. kanchil</em>, although <em>Tragulus k. williamsoni</em> Kloss, 1916, placed within <em>T. javanicus</em> from Van Bemmel (1949) onwards, was, however not returned, but was segregated as a monotypic species by Meijaard and Groves (2004). Further change within the taxonomy and nomenclature of the genus is likely, given the ominous statement in Meijaard and Groves (2004) that ""because many type specimens, especially of small island taxa are located in the Smithsonian Museum, which we did not visit, we were unable to assess the validity of all taxa.

Because it is known only from one specimen, it is difficult to determine the taxonomic significance of its large size (compared with <em>T. kanchil</em> and <em>T. javanicus</em>). This is compounded by the lack of available specimens of chevrotains from close to the type locality of <em>T. williamsoni</em> (in the northern highlands of Thailand) to test for conspecificity with <em>T. kanchil</em> and, if the taxon is validated, to determine the nature of the boundary with <em>T. kanchil</em> (sympatry or parapatry). More material is needed both of <em>T. williamsoni</em> and of <em>T. kanchil</em>, if it occurs, from the northern highlands of Southeast Asia and adjacent southern China, for a more informed judgment. Although Meijaard and Groves (2004) considered <em>T. williamsoni</em> to be “very large”, this is under conditions of museum measurement (“larger than the means of all other mouse-deer from the Asian mainland...for most of the individual measurements it was also larger than the maximum values for the ....mainland Asia <em>T. kanchil</em> subspecies”. No difference is likely to be apparent if measurements are not taken, so records hitherto assigned to <em>T. kanchil</em> (mostly under the name <em>T. javanicus</em>) from areas of northern Southeast Asia and China which have not been validated by specimens must now be regarded as indeterminate. Even measurements need careful interpretation: Kuznetzov and Borissenko (2004) measured skulls from southern Viet Nam (far from the holotype of <em>T. williamsoni</em>) of what they assigned to <em>T. kanchil</em> and found sizes exceeding those documented for Indochinese <em>T. kanchil</em> by Meijaard and Groves (2004) and even approaching those of <em>T. williamsoni</em>. They underlined how differences between individual people in style of skull measurement can be as significant as actual differences size in terms of apparent size results when measuring skulls of similar species. If <em>T. williamsoni</em> is a valid taxon, confirming additional specimens as such will clearly require great care."

Groves (2007) reviewed the hypodigm upon which the name&#160;<em>M. russelliana&#160;</em>was based - which was the only material he could trace, and probably constitutes an adult female and her litter (Allen 1938) - and the original description of&#160;<em>M. aistoodonnivalis</em>, supplemented by photographs. He concluded that both were valid species, and that they were probably closer to Yellow-bellied Weasel&#160;<em>M. kathiah</em>&#160;than to&#160;Least Weasel. On the information available, they differed from each other only in size and his proposed&#160;treatment of them as species was expressly under a phylogenetic species concept, based on measurements.

Dholes were later recognized as a single species (Ellerman and Morrison-Scott 1966), but separated into as many as 11 subspecies based on differences in coat length and colour (Durbin <em>et al</em>. 2004). The validity of many of these subspecies is doubtful, and a genetics study found no clear subspecies distinctions (Iyengar <em>et al</em>. 2005). However, samples used by Iyengar <em>et al</em>. (2005) came exclusively from the southern half of the Dhole distribution, so the genetic distinctiveness between northern and southern Dholes remains unknown. Examination of the auditory bulla showed at least one northern subspecies, from the Tian Shan Mountains, to be morphologically distinct from other subspecies (Ivanoff 2007). Further research is needed to clarify the morphological and genetic differences between northern and southern dholes, especially because conservation efforts would need to employ different strategies for the two groups, as they occupy vastly different habitats and prey on different species.<br/><br/>The putative northern-Dhole group historically occurred throughout East Asia to as far south as the Himalayan Mountains and the Yangtze River, and would include the following five subspecies described by Durbin <em>et al</em>.

They gave no sample sizes or information on animals in the area where the two forms abut, making it difficult to assess the validity of the proposal. This warrants priority investigation because the distributions of the two species mean that the western form is relatively secure, with large subpopulations in many well-managed protected areas, whereas the eastern form has very few apparently secure subpopulations and would, if assessed separately, warrant a Red List Category at least one level more threatened than that for the western form.</p><p><span lang=""EN-US""><br/></span></p>  <span lang=""EN-US"">Throughout at least Indochina there is a predictable flow of reports of ‘novel’ variation in large deer, with the implication that a new species may be involved (e.g. Pham Trong Anh <em>et al.</em> 1996 and, particularly, surveys through local people by overseas consultants); these stem from Sambar (often young animals) with unbranched antlers."

This became something of a mystery taxon and is different from the gazelles currently found there. Bärman <em>et al. </em>(2012) extracted DNA from the type specimen and showed that this was not a single specimen, assigning the skin to <em>G. g. cora </em>and the skull to gazelles of the northern type (<em>G. g. gazella</em>).<br/><br/>Wronski<em> et al.</em> (2010) showed that <em>Gazella gazella</em>, in fact, consists of two monophyletic lineages, a northern clade (represented by samples from the Golan Heights) and a southern clade (based on samples from the Arabian Peninsula including the southern Arava Valley), based on mtDNA markers. Lerp <em>et al.</em> (2012) produced similar conclusions using nuclear markers and including samples from Central Israel. A morphological and genetic study of genus <em>Gazella </em>(Bärmann <em>et al.</em> 2013), and a genetic study of gazelles in the southern Levant (Hadas<em> et al. </em>2015) all further support the existence of two monophyletic lineages: a northern clade (<em>Gazella gazella</em>), and a southern clade (provisionally named<em> G. arabica</em> on the basis that this name takes precedence over <em>cora</em>).<br/><br/>This arrangement is now followed by the IUCN SSC Antelope Specialist Group, with<em> G. gazella </em>replacing <em>G. g. gazella </em>in the former arrangement, and the name <em>G. arabica</em> provisionally retained for the southern clade, pending a ruling by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN). So <em>G. arabica</em>, as understood here, comprises all the gazelles formerly considered under<em> G. gazella</em>, from the southern Negev through the Arabian Peninsula.<br/><br/>Several subspecies have been named under <em>G. gazella</em> and have previously been evaluated for The IUCN Red List: <em>acaciae</em>; in the southern Arava Valley; <em>cora </em>in most of the Arabian Peninsula; <em>farasani </em>on the Farasan Islands; and&#160;<em>muscatensis </em>on the Batinah coast of Oman. Genetic research by scientists at King Khaled Wildlife Research Centre (Saudi Arabia) and Zoological Society of London (ZSL) has confirmed the existence of some intraspecific variation, but there is no agreement on the validity of these named subspecies and they are not assessed separately for the time being, until a definitive analysis has been produced.

In the last edition of the Red List, it was treated as a subspecies of <em>P. rufomitratus</em>,&#160;which included the subspecies <em>rufomitratus</em>, <em>semlikiensis, foai, langi, oustaleti, parmentieri, tephrosceles </em>and <em>tholloni</em>.</p><p>Gautier-Hion <em>et al.</em> (1999) regarded <em>P.</em> <em>oustaleti</em> as a complex of six forms, three west of the Ubangui (<em>P. <em>oustaleti</em> sensu stricto</em> with synonyms <em>umbrinus</em>, <em>nigrimanus</em> and an undescribed form from the vicinity of the Lobaye River, a tributary of the lower Ubangui, Central African Republic) and three to the east (<em>shubotzi</em>, <em>powelli</em> and <em>brunneus</em> with synonym <em>multicolor</em>). <em>P. oustaleti</em> is known to be highly variable in coat colour (Colyn 1993, Struhsaker 2010, Struhsaker and Grubb 2013). Ting (2008) found considerable mitochondrial genetic diversity among populations included within <em>P. oustaleti sensu lato </em>and suggested that either <em>oustaleti</em> might consist of numerous taxa, or that there have been past introgressions of mitochondrial lineages between neighbouring forms.</p>  <p>For the purpose of this assessment, we follow Groves (2007) in treating this diversity as a single taxonomic entity. However, we recognise that the taxonomic status of this form remains fluid.</p>"

Fischer, 1806)","Grubb <em>et al.</em> (2003) retained this taxon as <em>Galagoides demidovii</em>, while Groves (2005) listed this taxon as <em>Galago demidoff</em>. The species is sympatric over most of its range with <em>Galagoides thomasii</em>, and frequently confused.<br/><br/><p><span lang=""EN-US"">Grubb <em>et al</em>. (2003) concluded that the correct Latin name for Demidoff’s Galago was <em>demidovii</em>, as referred to in Fischer (1808) which was written in Latin with, consequently, the latinised name of Demidoff. This name was used by Oates (2011), Ambrose and Butynski (2013) and Nekaris (2013). Groves (2001), however, argued that <em>demidoff</em>, as written by Fischer (1806), was in fact being used as a Latin binomial, and was, as such. the correct name for this species. This was also argued by Masters and Couette (2015). Jenkins (1987) and Kingdon (1997) also used the name <em>demidoff.&#160;</em>Grubb (2004) discussed this issue and came down, if not firmly, on the side of the latinized, genitive rendering of the name published by Fischer in 1808. It was agreed at the African Primates Workshop held in Rome in April 2016, however, that <em>demidoff </em>was the correct epithet, and as such should be the one to use.<em><br/><br/></em>Groves (2001, 2005) recognized six subspecies, evidently, as pointed out by Masters and Couette (2015), following the concept of geospecies proposed by Grubb (2006): the nominate subspecies in “West Africa”; the Calabar Dwarf Galago<em> G. d. murinus </em>(Murray, 1859) in the Nigeria-Cameroon border region; the Bioko Dwarf Galago<em> G. d. poensis </em>(Thomas, 1904) from the island of Bioko; the Congo Dwarf Galago<em> G. d. anomurus </em>(de Pousargues, 1893) from between the Sanaga and Congo rivers; the Kasai Dwarf Galago <em>G. d. phasma </em>Cabrera and Ruxton, 1926, from the south of the Congo River; the Uele Dwarf Galago<em> G. d. medius </em>(Thomas, 1915) from the Uele-Ituri region; and undescribed form from Lake Oku, Bamenda Highlands, Cameroon. Kingdon (1997) listed these subspecies, as did Ambrose and Butynski (2013), the latter authors considering them, however, to be “tentative and provisional” (p. 460). Grubb <em>et al.</em> (2003) argued that <em>Galagoides demidoff</em> was best considered monotypic. Masters and Couette (2015) carried out a cranial and dental morphometric study of <em>G. demidoff</em> and <em>G. thomasi</em>.&#160;On the basis of this study, they found “slight but consistent morphological differences between <em>G. demidoff</em> and <em>G. thomasi</em>, but could not validate the subspecies described for the former taxon” (p. 297). The Bioko form, <em>G. d. poensis</em>, is assessed here as a separate subspecies as is the nominate subspecies.</p>"

This was provisionally followed by Wozencraft (2005). However, genetic analysis supports the existence of populations subdivision in this species, but not at the species level (Johnson <em>et al.</em> 1999).  The genetic partitioning (Uruguay and southern Brazil; Bolivia and northern Chile; and western Argentina and central Chile: Johnson <em>et al.</em> 1999) is somewhat different from the divisions recognized by Garcia-Perea (1994) on the basis of morphology (central Chile; the Andes from Ecuador and south to through Argentina; and Uruguay, Paraguay and Brazil).

Although Przewalski's Horse (<em>Equus ferus przewalskii</em>) can hybridize with domestic horses (<em>Equus ferus caballus</em>) to produce fertile offspring (Ryder <em>et al.</em> 1978, Trommerhausen-Smith <em>et al.</em> 1979), the existence of 2n = 66 chromosomes in Przewalski's Horse identifies it as being more different from its domestic relatives (2n = 64) than are any two breeds of domestic horse (Ryder 1994). Furthermore, mitochondrial DNA research has shown that the&#160;Przewalski's Horse&#160;is not the ancestor of modern domestic horses (Vilà <em>et al. </em>2001).&#160;Przewalski's Horse&#160;also show a number of consistent differences in their appearance as compared to domestic horse breeds: the mane is short and erect when in good body condition; forelocks are nearly nonexistent; the upper part of the tail has short guard hairs; a dark dorsal stripe runs from the mane down the spine to the tail; several dark stripes can be present on the carpus and generally the tarsus (Groves 1994).&#160;Przewalski's Horses&#160;grow a thick mane in winter, which contrary to domestic horses they shed each spring with the rest of their winter coat. <br/> <br/> Other studies of the genetic differences between Przewalski's and domestic horses have indicated very little genetic distinction between them. Only four alleles at four separate serological marker loci have been identified as specific to&#160;Przewalski's Horse&#160;(Bowling and Ryder 1987); the vast majority of blood protein variants are present in both Przewalski's and domestic horses and even the fastest evolving DNA region known in mammals (the mitochondrial DNA control region), does not show significant differences between the two types of horse (Ishida<em> et al. </em>1995, Oakenfull and Ryder 1998). Thus it is clear that Przewalski's and domestic horses are very closely related and have in the past interbred, but the fixed chromosomal number difference between them indicates that they are distinct populations (Oakenfull <em>et al. </em>2000). A variety of molecular studies support their phylogenetic relationship as sister taxa (Steiner <em>et al. </em>2012, Côté <em>et al. </em>2013) diverging between 150,000 and 250,000 years ago (Goto <em>et al. </em>2011, Steiner and Ryder 2011)."

The original type specimen of <em>N. diardi</em> originated from Sumatra, but it was initially recorded in error as from Java (Kitchener <em>et al.</em> 2006). As this type specimen described by Cuvier (1823) is not present in any museum, Christiansen 2009 designated a Neoptype (RMNH1981) from Palembang, Sumatra, which is housed at the National Museum of Natural History (Naturalis), in Leiden, the Netherlands. Clouded Leopard fossils have been found on Java, where it perhaps became extinct in the Holocene (Meijaard 2004).

On the basis of morphology, Zunino&#160;<em>et al</em>. (1995) reviewed previous work and also supported clustering species within the two previous paraphyletic genera (<em>Pseudalopex</em>,&#160;<em>Lycalopex</em>) into a single monophyletic genus. They further argued that&#160;<em>Lycalopex&#160;</em>had priority over&#160;<em>Pseudalopex</em>, subsequently also supported by Zrzavý&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2004: 324). The only outstanding question would have been whether&#160;<em>Dusicyon&#160;</em>would have been a more appropriate name, since Perini&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2010) reported a close relationship between&#160;<em>L. culpaeus</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>Dusicyon</em>.

Several subspecies have been proposed based  on extensive variation in pelage colour and morphology across the  distribution. Within southern Africa, Roberts (1951) proposed 20  subspecies of which Meester <em>et al. </em>(1986) regarded only seven as being  valid. Rambau <em>et al.</em> (2003) recommended the recognition of two species  based on cytogenetic and mitochondrial sequence data, the xeric <em>R</em>.<em> pumilio</em> and mesic <em>R</em>. <em>dilectus</em>, which was adopted by Musser and Carleton (2005). The authors further suggested the presence of two subspecies, <em>R</em>. <em>d</em>. <em>dilectus</em> and <em>R</em>.<em> d</em>. <em>chakae</em> within the latter taxon. This was confirmed in a recent molecular and chromosomal analysis of <em>R</em>. <em>dilectus</em>,  which revealed high genetic divergence within the species, and the  presence of three distinct clades (Castiglia <em>et al. </em>2012). The basal  clade, recognised as <em>R</em>. <em>d</em>. <em>chakae</em> is endemic to South Africa, while the two distinct sister clades (<em>R</em>. <em>d</em>. <em>dilectus</em>)  are distributed allopatrically across northern parts of its range, into  East Africa, including a new divergent karyotype found in the high  altitudes of Mt. Meru and Mt. Kilimanjaro (Castiglia <em>et al.</em> 2012).  Reproductive isolation due to pre- and post-mating barriers have been  found among <em>R</em>. <em>pumilio</em> and <em>R</em>.<em> dilectus</em>, as  well as among the proposed subspecies within the latter taxon (Pillay  2000; Pillay <em>et al.</em> 2006). Subsequently, du Toit <em>et al. </em>(2012) indicated  three genetic lineages with distinct distributions related to biome  boundaries within the xeric <em>R</em>. <em>pumilio</em>. Based on deep mitochondrial genetic divergence, paraphyly of <em>R</em>. <em>pumilio </em>with respect to <em>R</em>. <em>dilectus</em> and different ecological preferences of the three genetic lineages within <em>R</em>. <em>pumilio</em>, the recognition of four species (<em>R</em>. <em>dilectus</em>,<em> R</em>. <em>pumilio</em>, <em>R</em>. <em>bechuanae</em>, and <em>R</em>. <em>intermedius</em>) was suggested (du Toit<em> et al.</em> 2012). However, Monadjem <em>et al. </em>(2015) recognise <em>R</em>.<em> chakae</em> as a valid species due to at least one case of known sympatry between <em>R</em>. <em>d</em>. <em>dilectus</em> and <em>R</em>. <em>d</em>.<em> chakae</em>.  Further molecular research (particularly including more nuclear data)  and cranial morphometric analyses would be useful to fully resolve the  taxonomy of the genus. Until such time, it is recommended that <em>Rhabdomys</em> be treated as a species complex."

Therefore, the genus <em>Micaelamys</em> now includes <em>M</em>. <em>namaquensis</em> and <em>M</em>. <em>granti</em>. This close relationship between the species is evident from dental morphology, karyology, gross sperm and bacular morphology and cranial phenetic analysis.

However, a comprehensive intraspecific morphometric study within <em>M</em>. <em>namaquensis</em> covering a wide geographic range showed that patterns of intraspecific variation suggested the recognition of four subspecies based on traditional morphology/cranial morphometrics (Chimimba 2001). Similarly, a recent molecular study identified at least eight well supported lineages based on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences (Russo et al. 2010). This differentiation (considerable mtDNA diversity) is in contrast with the most recent taxonomic treatment, which only recognised four subspecies. Some of the mtDNA lineages broadly correspond with the distributional patterns of the previously described subspecies <em>monticularis</em>, <em>namaquensis</em>, <em>lehocla</em> and <em>alborarius</em>.

Allen, 1940; Ellerman and Morrison-Scott 1951; Gromov and Polyakov 1977; Hinton 1926; also see references in Kaneko 1990) but it was treated as a separate species by Corbet (1978). In a study of red-backed voles from Russia, northeastern China, and Korea, Kaneko (1990) thoroughly documented morphological distinctions between <i>M. rufocanus</i> and <i>M. regulus</i>, considering the latter to be a Korean endemic and suggesting  that ""the true geographical demarcation line between the two species lies on the western and southern boundary of the Kaima Plateau, North Korea."" Kaneko also discovered that adult and old <i>regulus</i> lack molar roots, a key character for separating <i>Myodes</i> from <i>Eothenomys</i>, and so transferred it to <i>Eothenomys</i>.
<br>
<br>Subsequent mitochondrial and nuclear ribosomal DNA analyses conclusively demonstrate that <i>M. regulus</i> is distinct but phylogenetically close to <i>M. rufocanus</i>, not typical <i>Eothenomys</i> (Suzuki <i>et al</i>. 1999). Wakana <i>et al</i>. (1996) noted that the ""absence of rooting of the molars in the Korean vole … is a characteristic that may have developed within a short period of evolutional time in the Korean population."" The G-banding pattern of <i>regulus</i> is ""essentially identical"" to that of <i>M. rufocanus</i>, both differing from <i>M. glareolus</i>, but Y-chromosome morphology implicates closer relationship between <i>M. regulus</i> and <i>M. smithii</i> (Iwasa <i>et al</i>., 1999), a Japanese vole also having unrooted molars. Iwasa <i>et al</i>. (1999) stated that phylogenetic affinities among <i>rufocanus</i>, <i>regulus</i>, and <i>smithii&lt;/i. ""are extremely complicated."" To this complicated mix must be added <i>M. shanseius</i> (also rootless), which is so morphologically similar to <i>M. regulus</i> that the same specimens have been variously identified as one or the other. They differ only in length of tail, interorbital breadth, and M3 occlusal patterns; as currently known, their distributions are allopatric, perhaps separated by the Liao He River in Liaoning Province (Kaneko, 1992). The genetic integrity of <i>M. regulus</i> relative to <i>M. shanseius</i> similarly warrants additional study."

Genetically, <em>G</em>. <em>cometes</em> is very close to <em>G</em>. <em>dolichurus</em> (mean sequence divergence of 3.4% ± 0.8% SE) and these two thicket rats have identical diploid number of chromosomes (2n = 52).

Only the southern-most population of <em>G</em>.<em> cometes </em>from Amathole forest complex has been satisfactorily defined by means of morphology, karyology, and molecular markers (Kryštufek et al. 2008).

However, they are closely related phylogenetically, i.e., sister species. Phylogeographical surveys using mitochondrial sequences (Cytb) have uncovered four distinctive clades throughout sub-Saharan Africa (but possibly more, see Bryja et al. 2014): West Africa, western Central Africa, East Africa and southern Africa. The latter two clades occur within the assessment region where they can be further subdivided into chromosomal groups. Pygmy Mice from the East African clade have a diploid number of 33 &lt; 2n &lt; 35, while the southern African clade harbours two subclades: one with 2n = 34 and the other 2n = 18. The 2n = 18 subclade is endemic to South Africa (Veyrunes et al. 2004, 2005, 2010, 2014; Kouassi et al. 2008; Mboumba et al. 2011; McDonough et al. 2013; Chevret et al. 2014; Lamb et al. 2014)."

(1986) listed six subspecies from sub-Saharan Africa, including <em>P.</em> <em>p</em>. <em>ornatus</em> (Gray 1864) from Ngoye Forest and <em>P</em>. <em>p</em>. <em>tongensis</em> (Roberts, 1931) from Manguzi Forest in KwaZulu-Natal, it is unclear whether these taxa have distinct phenotypes or genotypes (Mugo et al. 1995). Similarly, Thorington Jr. et al. (2012) listed seven subspecies of <em>P</em>. <em>palliatus</em> but only listed <em>P</em>. <em>p</em>. <em>ornatus</em> as occurring in South Africa (Ngoye Forest, Eshowe District, Zululand). While Viljoen (Viljoen 1980, 1989) suggested a rise to species status for both taxa, which was taken up by Friedmann and Daly (2004), this has not been corroborated by molecular or morphometric research. Thus, given the confusion around the taxonomy due to the lack of genetic evidence and the species’ propensity for varied morphology, we assess at the species level, but recognise that<em> P</em>. <em>p</em>. <em>ornatus</em> is a distinct form that distinguishes it from the rest of its African range."

Defler and Hernández-Camacho (2002) established a neotype for&#160;<em>C. a. albifrons</em>, and argued that&#160;<em>C. a. unicolor&#160;</em>was a junior synonym (see also Defler 2004).&#160;<br/>Defler (2004) listed and described five subspecies for mainland Colombia: 1)&#160;<em>Cebus albifrons albifrons</em>&#160;(Humboldt, 1812) (<em>C. a. unicolor</em>&#160;a synonym), 2)&#160;<em>Cebus albifrons yuracus</em>&#160;Hershkovitz, 1949 (considered a synonym of&#160;<em>C. a. cuscinus</em>&#160;Thomas, 1901, by Groves [2001]); 3)&#160;<em>Cebus albifrons malitiosus</em>&#160;Elliot, 1909 (considered a synonym of&#160;<em>C. a. versicolor</em>&#160;Pucheran, 1845, by Groves [2001]),&#160;<em>Cebus albifrons cesarae</em>&#160;Hershkovitz, 1949 (considered a synonym of&#160;<em>C. a. versicolor</em>&#160;Pucheran, 1845, by Groves [2001]),&#160;<em>Cebus albifrons versicolor</em>&#160;Pucheran, 1845 (with&#160;<em>C. a. leucocephalus</em>&#160;Gray 1865 and&#160;<em>C. a. pleei&#160;</em>Hershkovitz, 1949, as synonyms).&#160;<br/><br/>Recent molecular studies have evidenced that the former<em> C. a. albifrons</em> populations are not sister taxa to other gracile capuchin populations in northern South America (<em>C. capucinus, C. versicolor, C. malitiosus, C. leucocephalus </em>or <em>C. brunneus</em>) (Boubli <em>et al.</em> 2012; Lynch Alfaro <em>et al. </em>2012). Thus, independent of their morphological similarities to these geographically disjunct populations, <em>C. albifrons</em> currently refers to gracile capuchins living in the upper Amazon basin in Southeastern Colombia, southern Venezuela and northwestern Brazil (Mittermeier<em> et al. </em>2014).&#160; There is some uncertainty whether the range of <em>C. albifrons</em> should be restricted to between the Rio Negro and Rio Branco (Boubli<em> et al.</em> 2012) or should extend south as well from the Rio Negro to the Rio Solimões in western Brazil (Rylands <em>et al.</em> 2014)."

Examination of mitochondrial DNA has also indicated genetic differences between Atlantic and eastern Mediterranean Monk Seal populations: only one haplotype was found in Monk Seals in Madeira and Cabo Blanco in the Atlantic in contrast to four different haplotypes found in Monk Seals in the eastern Mediterranean (i.e., Libya, Croatia, and Greece; Karamanlidis <em>et al</em>. 2014a). Furthermore, a comparison of 24 nuclear microsatellite loci in eastern Mediterranean and western Sahara (Atlantic) Monk Seals showed that the first group had 14 unique alleles and the second had 18; highly significant differences in allele frequencies between the two subpopulations were found for 14 out of 17 loci (Pastor <em>et al</em>. 2007).

Through a comparison of cranio-mandibular and dental characters from an orangutan killed during human-orangutan conflict to 33 adult male orangutans of similar developmental stage, the study found consistent differences between the Batang Toru individual and other extant Ponginae. Model-based approaches based on the analyses of 37 orangutan genomes supported the morphological results by revealing that the deepest split in the evolutionary history of extant orangutans occurred ~3.38 Ma ago between the Batang Toru population and those to the north of Lake Toba, while both currently recognized species separated much later at about 674 ka.

Several genetic studies have recently tried to clarify the taxonomy of this species complex, but their results are not always concordant.<br/><br/>Although Grubb (in Wilson and Reeder 2005) included <em>canadensis</em> in <em>C. elaphus</em>, sharing this conclusion with most taxonomists of 20th century, all original scientific papers published since 1995 have concluded that<em> C. elaphus</em> and <em>C. canadensis</em> are two valid species regardless of whether this conclusion was based on comparison of molecular (Kuwuyama and Ozawa 1999, Randi <em>et al.</em> 2001, Ludt <em>et al.</em> 2004, Pitra <em>et al.</em> 2004, Zhang and Zhang 2012, Liu <em>et al.</em> 2013, Lorenzini and Garofolo 2015), or ethological data (Cap <em>et al.</em> 2008, Frey and Riede 2013, Pereladova 2013). Based on morphological data this was suggested earlier by several authors, e.g. Lydekker (1898), Flerov (1952) and Geist (1998) and both recent reviews on cervid taxonomy are in line with this opinion (Groves and Grubb 2011, Mattioli 2011).<br/><br/>Recent analysis of the <em>Cervus </em>group (Lorenzini and Garofolo 2015, Mukesh <em>et al.</em> 2015, Kumar <em>et al. </em>2016) have provided the first indications of another, fourth species (including <em>Cervus nippon</em> sensu latu). Mitochondrial complete cytochrome b and control region sequences were analysed under a Bayesian coalescent framework to derive phylogeny, with particular attention on populations from Central Asia. The resultant phylogenetic reconstruction suggested that, after excision of <em>C. canadensis</em>, red deer are differentiated&#160; into two robust monophyletic clades corresponding to the western and eastern part of the range. At the species level, molecular data suggested this fourth species should be recognized as the Tarim Red Deer from Central Asia, including the populations from the Yarkand-Tarim and Bukhara regions and Indian Kashmir, which were formerly considered as subspecies of <em>C. elaphus</em> (<em>C. e yarkandensis</em>, <em>C .e. bactrianus</em> and <em>C. e. hanglu</em>, respectively). <br/><br/>Lorenzini and Garofolo (2015) suggest this taxon should be recognized as the Tarim Red Deer <em>Cervus hanglu</em> Wagner, 1844, as the name with priority over <em>C. yarkandensis</em> or <em>C. bactrianus</em>. This group forms a part of the western clade and appears to have diverged from <em>C. elaphus</em> during the middle Pleistocene, at a similar time as <em>C. nippon</em> diverged from <em>C. canadensis</em>. The genetic distinctiveness of the Tarim Red Deer group is supported by previous mitochondrial studies (Ludt <em>et al.</em> 2004, Pitra <em>et al.</em> 2004, Mukesh <em>et al.</em> 2015). Further investigations need to be conducted from additional molecular sources and nuclear coding genes as well as verification of morphology from museum specimens, before the elevation of the Tarim Red Deer to species level can be confirmed (Lorenzini and Garofalo 2015). <em>Cervus hanglu </em>was elevated to species level for the purpose of the IUCN Red List assessment in 2016. However, it should be noted that future clarification on genetic relatedness, especially studies with nuclear markers and a more formal morphological description, may lead to further revisions to the taxonomuy of this provisional species, as more information becomes available.<br/><br/><em>C. h. bactrianus</em> and <em>C. h. yarkandensis</em> were not supported as distinct subspecies by molecular data (Lorenzini and Garofolo 2015).

The dolphin skull and a shark-mauled carcass of a West African manatee were apparently recovered by Tëusz following a heavy rain storm and were subsequently confused (Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2004). The stomach of the manatee contained vegetable matter, leading Kükenthal to hypothesize that the species was perhaps riparian and vegetarian, an impression reinforced by the dolphin’s rounded (worn) teeth. The Belgian zoologist Pierre Joseph Van Beneden (with whom Kükenthal corresponded) compounded the misunderstanding in a separate publication (Kükenthal 1891, Kükenthal 1892, Van Beneden 1892, Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2004). Necropsies of fresh animals in the 1950s confirmed that they were piscivorous and marine (Cadenat 1956, Cadenat and Paraiso 1957).<br/><br/>Recent genetic and morphometric work has served to clarify the taxonomy of the genus <em>Sousa</em> (Jefferson and Rosenbaum 2014, Jefferson and Van Waerebeek 2004, Mendez <em>et al</em>. 2013). The available data indicate that there is “strong and significant genetic and morphologic differentiation between <em>S. teuszii</em> and all other sampling units…with no evidence of exchange or contact” (Mendez <em>et al</em>. 2013). Principal components analysis demonstrated that <em>S. teuszii</em> have significantly shorter rostra, wider skulls and lower tooth counts (an average of about 30 teeth per row vs. about 33-37 for other species) when compared with Southeast African, Arabian/Persian Gulf and Indian <em>Sousa</em> specimens (Jefferson and Rosenbaum 2014, Jefferson and Van Waerebeek 2004). There are no shared mtDNA haplotypes with other species in the genus, but a phylogenetic assessment of combined nuclear and mtDNA datasets indicates that <em>S. teuszii </em>is most closely related to Indian Ocean Humpback Dolphins (<em>Sousa plumbea</em>) from South East Africa (Mendez <em>et al</em>. 2013). The most plausible mechanism for their isolation is the Benguela upwelling system, an area dominated by cold upwelling that is located within the ~2,000 km distribution gap between <em>S. teuszii</em> and <em>S. plumbea</em> (Jefferson and Van Waerebeek 2004, Mendez <em>et al</em>. 2013)."

A follow-up paper by Jefferson and Rosenbaum (2014) reviewed all the available taxonomic evidence and nomenclature, and proposed a formal revision of the genus’ taxonomy. In this scheme, humpback dolphins found in the Indian and Pacific oceans are split into three species: <em>S. plumbea</em> (Indian Ocean Humpback Dolphin), found only in the western Indian Ocean; <em>S. chinensis</em> (Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphin), found in the eastern Indian Ocean and throughout Southeast Asia; and <em>S. sahulensis</em> (Australian Humpback Dolphin), found off northern Australia and southern New Guinea. &#160;The Atlantic Humpback Dolphin, <em>S. teuszii</em>, is the fourth species in the genus, found only off West Africa. &#160;This view has been accepted by the Society for Marine Mammalogy’s Committee on Taxonomy (Society for Marine Mammalogy 2014).<br/><br/>There are still several unresolved issues in humpback dolphin taxonomy. &#160;Humpback dolphins off Bangladesh have been assumed to correspond to <em>S. chinensis</em>, based on external appearance (primarily the shape of the dorsal fin, absence of a dorsal hump, and similar spotting patterns – see Smith <em>et al.</em>&#160;2008), but recent mtDNA genetic evidence suggests that they do not group with either <em>S. chinensis </em>or <em>S. plumbea</em>, and may in fact be more closely related phylogenetically to <em>S. sahulensis</em> (Amaral <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). &#160;Further work is needed to clarify their taxonomic status, but for this assessment they are provisionally included, with the caveat that future work may very well show them to be of a species separate from <em>S. chinensis</em>. In fact, the taxonomic affinities of humpback dolphins in the entire Bay of Bengal (i.e., eastern India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Myanmar) need to be urgently re-examined. There is also still some uncertainty regarding the exact taxonomic status of populations observed in Mainland Malaysia and Borneo (see Minton <em>et al.</em> 2016).<br/>There is extensive geographic variation below the level of the species in <em>S. chinensis</em>, most of it not yet properly documented, and the validity/limits of most proposed subspecies or geographic forms are not yet well known. &#160;However, the taxonomic status of the Eastern Taiwan Strait subpopulation has recently been evaluated, and has been proposed to represent a subspecies, <em>S. chinensis taiwanensis</em> Wang <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015. The nominotypological subspecies, <em>S. chinensis chinensis</em>, would then apply to all other animals in the species (Wang <em>et al</em>. 2015).

Nine subspecies of Giraffes are currently recognized (Dagg 2014), although some authorities dispute this taxonomic classification (e.g., Groves and Grubb 2011). Several subpopulations of Giraffe, resident in northern Botswana, northwest Zimbabwe, northeastern Namibia and southwestern Zambia, are potentially either&#160;<em>G. c. angolensis</em>, or&#160;<em>G. c. giraffa</em>&#160;but the continued accumulation of information indicates that a future reassessment might be in order. Until an extensive reassessment of the taxonomic status of giraffes is completed, therefore, it is premature to alter the taxonomic&#160;<em>status quo</em>. This assessment is based upon an interim consensus that a single species of giraffes is resident on the African continent.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Taxonomic Notes for South African Regional Assessment:<br/></strong>Currently, nine subspecies classifications have been proposed for Giraffe (Ansell 1972; Dagg &amp; Foster 1982; Kingdon 1997; East 1999; Grubb 2005; Ciofolo &amp; Pendu 2013). There is considerable uncertainty surrounding the geographic and taxonomic limits of all described subspecies (Fennessy et al. 2013). Furthermore, recent genetic work suggests that several subspecies may even represent distinct species (Brown et al. 2007). Globally, only the forms <em>G</em>. <em>c</em>. <em>peralta</em> from West Africa, which recent genetic evidence has confirmed is indeed distinct (Hassanin et al. 2007), and <em>G</em>. <em>c</em>. <em>rothschildi</em> have been assessed at the subspecies level. Giraffe taxonomy of the various populations in Africa has largely been reliant on the variation of pelage pattern and geographic range. However, this has long been inconclusive. Even advances in molecular methods have left many aspects uncertain, often because of limited sampling (Fennessy et al. 2013). A good knowledge of Giraffe genetics, however, is critical for their long-term sustainable management with an estimated population of less than 80,000 remaining in the wild. In particular, the taxonomic assignment and phylogeography of two populations in southern Africa, the South African Giraffe (<em>G</em>. <em>c</em>. <em>giraffa</em>) and the Namibian Giraffe (<em>G</em>. <em>c</em>. <em>angolensis</em>), remains uncertain. To resolve this and estimate the divergence times among Giraffe populations, an increase in sampling effort across this region as well as more broadly across Africa is very important (Bock et al. 2014). The South African, or Cape, Giraffe was formerly classified as <em>G</em>. <em>c</em>. <em>capensis</em>. In this assessment, we treat <em>G</em>. <em>c</em>. <em>giraffa</em> as a subspecies in southern Africa (Seymour 2001; Brown et al. 2007; Dagg 2014)."

At the species level, molecular data suggested a fourth species should be recognised, the Tarim Red Deer from Central Asia, including the populations from the Yarkand-Tarim and Bukhara regions and Indian Kashmir, which were formerly considered as subspecies of <em>C. elaphus </em>(<em>C. e. yarkandensis</em>, <em>C.e. bactrianus</em> and <em>C.e. hanglu</em>, respectively).

Further investigations need to be conducted from additional molecular sources and nuclear coding genes as well as verification of morphology from museum specimens, before the elevation of this taxon to species level can be confirmed (Lorenzini and Garofalo 2015). We provisionally follow this taxonomy here for the purpose of the IUCN Red List assessment in 2016.

Further investigations need to be conducted from additional molecular sources and nuclear coding genes as well as verification of morphology from museum specimens, before the elevation of this taxon to species level can be confirmed (Lorenzini and Garofalo 2015). We provisionally follow this taxonomy here for the purpose of the IUCN Red List assessment in 2016. However, it should be noted that future clarification on genetic relatedness, especially studies with nuclear markers and a more formal morphological description, may lead to further revisions to the taxonomy of the provisional species, <em>C. hanglu</em>, as more information becomes available.<br/><br/>Several subspecies of Western Red Deer have been recognized with their ranges as follows:<br/><em>C. e. elaphus</em>: Ireland, Great Britain,&#160;&#160; continental Europe <br/><em>C. e. barbarus</em>: Atlas Mountains (Algeria, Tunisia)<br/><em>C. e. corsicanus</em>: Corsica (extinct, reintroduced in 1985), Sardinia<br/><em>C. e. maral</em>: Anatolia,<br/><em>C. e. italicus</em>: Italy (Ferrara)<br/><em>C. e. brauneri</em> Crimea (Russia)<br/><em>C. e. montanus</em> (syn. <em>Carpathicus</em>) Carpathian mountains<br/><br/><em>C. e. italicus</em> (Mesola Red Deer) has been recently described as a new subspecies, based on morphological and genetic characteristics, from the Bosco Della Mesola Nature Reserve, which is thought to be the only autochthonous population of Red Deer in the Italian Peninsula (Zachos <em>et al.</em> 2014). This conclusion is supported by Lorenzini and Garofalo (2015). However, recent analyses call into question the veracity of the morphology-based subspecific taxonomy of <em>C. elaphus</em> more generally. Rather, three genetic lineages were clearly differentiated corresponding approximately with geographical factors. One lineage was distributed in central-western Europe (and also Ukraine), one from eastern Europe to the Middle East, and a third which corresponded to <em>C. e. barbarus</em> and <em>C. e. corsicanus</em> from North Africa and Sardinia, the latter two nomials are considered synonyms and were recommended considered as a subspecies (Lorenzini and Garofalo 2015). This work suggests that revision of the subspecific taxonomy of <em>C. elaphus</em> could be beneficial."

181359,Sotalia guianensis,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,CETARTIODACTYLA,MAMMALIA,DELPHINIDAE,Sotalia,guianensis,,,,,"(Van Bénéden, 1864)","<p>Two species are recognized in the genus <em>Sotalia</em>:<em> S</em>. <em>guianensis,&#160;</em>the Guiana Dolphin,<em> </em>and <em>S</em>. <em>fluviatilis</em>, the Tucuxi. They are very similar in appearance and the genus was long considered monotypic. Two issues concerning the taxonomy of the dolphins in particular parts of the range of the genus deserve mention.<br/><br/>First, there is some uncertainty about the taxonomic status and range of Guiana Dolphins in the Orinoco River. There are frequent records of <em>Sotalia </em>at Ciudad Bolívar, some 300 km upstream from the river mouth. Such records are suspected to correspond to <em>S. guianensis</em> (da Silva and Best 1996, Meade and Koehnken 1991, Flores and da Silva 2009, da Silva <em>et al</em>. 2010). It is generally assumed that <em>Sotalia </em>dolphins cannot traverse the rapids at the Casiquiare Channel, which connects the Orinoco and Amazon basins (da Silva and Best 1996). This barrier has existed since the uplift of the Mérida Cordillera (10 million years ago; Lundberg <em>et al.</em> 1998), which predates the divergence of the two species of <em>Sotalia </em>(Cunha <em>et al. </em>2005, Caballero <em>et al.</em> 2007, 2008). Thus, <em>Sotalia </em>in the Middle Orinoco are likely to be an isolated population of Guiana Dolphins (da Silva <em>et al</em>. 2010, Cunha <em>et al.</em> 2010). Seven animals from the Orinoco all possessed the same mitochondrial DNA sequences and had an estimated divergence from <em>S. guianensis</em> of 640,000 years ago (Caballero <em>et al</em>. 2017). Caballero <em>et al.</em> (2017) suggested that the Orinoco River animals belong to an independent population unit isolated from other coastal populations and worthy of separate conservation and management efforts.<br/><br/>The second issue relates to the taxonomic status of <em>Sotalia </em>dolphins from the southern freshwater portion of Maracaibo Lake. Those individuals are morphologically different from the marine <em>Sotalia </em>that inhabit the northern portion of the lake, adjacent to the Gulf of Venezuela. Dolphins from southern Maracaibo are smaller than marine <em>Sotalia</em> and about the same size as <em>S. fluviatilis </em>(Casinos <em>et al.</em> 1981, da Silva and Best 1996, León 2005). However, there is no connection between Maracaibo Lake and the known present-day range of riverine <em>Sotalia</em>, and the lake has been isolated from the Amazon basin for the last 8-10 million years (Hoorn <em>et al. </em>1995, Días de Gamero 1996 cited in Cunha <em>et al.</em> 2010). The morphological distinctiveness of the southern Maracaibo Lake <em>Sotalia</em> population could be a result of phenotypic plasticity, unlike the difference between <em>S. guianensis </em>and <em>S. fluviatilis</em>. However, it may also indicate a lack of gene flow with the marine <em>Sotalia </em>from the mouth of the lake and the Gulf of Venezuela. Indeed, Caballero <em>et al.</em> (2006) observed some exclusive haplotypes in samples from the lake, but they did not consider this to signify a species-level difference. All haplotypes in Maracaibo Lake were <em>S</em>. <em>guianensis </em>(Caballero <em>et al</em>. 2017) with one of those being most closely related to the single haplotype found in the Orinoco River. Both of the populations here—in Maracaibo Lake and the Orinoco River—would meet the IUCN definition of a subpopulation.</p>"

The morphology of Omura’s Whale is quite distinct from those of Bryde’s Whales and other known baleen whales, but its colouration resembles that of the Fin Whale (<em>B. physalus</em>) while lacking lateral rostral ridges (Wada <em>et al.</em> 2003).<br/><br/>To date (December 2017), the only genetically confirmed observations of living Omura’s Whales are of 18 biopsied individuals in an apparently resident population off northwestern Madagascar (Cerchio <em>et al.</em> 2015). Specimens collected in 1976 in the Solomon Sea (Ohsumi 1978) and in 1978 in the eastern Indian Ocean (Ohsumi 1980) were originally taken under a scientific permit for Bryde’s Whales and were subsequently genetically identified as Omura’s Whales (Wada<em> et al</em>. 2003). LeDuc and Dizon (2002) genetically analysed specimens of small “Bryde’s Whales” from the Bohol Sea, Philippines, and found that they segregated phylogenetically outside the Sei/Bryde’s Whale clade and basal to <em>B. edeni/B. borealis</em>. From a comparison of the published phylogenies, Sasaki<em> et al</em>. (2006) concluded that these specimens corresponded to Omura’s Whale. Yamada <em>et al. </em>(2008) identified 24 skulls from a whaling operation in the Philippines as Omura’s Whales.<br/><br/><u>UAE Taxonomic Note<br/></u>Although it was only recently described (Wada <em>et al</em>. 2003), the separate species identity of Omura’s Whale <em>Balaenoptera omurai</em>, is now well established phylogenetically (Sasaki <em>et al</em>. 2006).

However, there is evidence of geographic variability in skull morphology and life history (Kitchener <em>et al</em><span class=""datalabel1"">. 1990, Ferreira <em>et al</em><span class=""datalabel1"">. 2014). Based on genetics there is substantial population structure, both between and within-ocean basins, and even within a single archipelago (Martien <em>et al</em><span class=""datalabel1"">. 2014). This species has been intensively studied only in Hawaii (Baird 2016) and more recently in New Zealand (Zaeschmar 2014). In Hawaii, three subpopulations have been identified based on a combination of genetic studies (Martien <em>et al</em><span class=""datalabel1"">. 2014), satellite tagging (Baird <em>et al</em><span class=""datalabel1"">. 2010, 2012, 2014, Bradford <em>et al</em><span class=""datalabel1"">. 2014a), and analyses of photo-identification data (Baird <em>et al</em><span class=""datalabel1"">. 2008, Baird 2016). These include two partially overlapping insular populations, one around the main Hawaiian Islands, and one in the northwestern Hawaiian Islands, as well as a partially overlapping pelagic population that ranges throughout and beyond the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) around the Hawaiian Archipelago. In New Zealand, based on high resighting rates of photo-identified individuals and a relatively small number of individuals documented, it is likely that this represents a distinct subpopulation (Zaeschmar 2014). While the number of subpopulations world-wide is unknown, this is due primarily to incomplete sampling in most of the range. Based on the evidence from Hawaii, subpopulation structure likely exists throughout their range.</span></span></span></span>"
